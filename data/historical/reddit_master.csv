2025-06-04,"~3 Year Update: I Took Out $150,000 in Personal Loans to Buy Crypto","**tl;dr:**  Over the course of the past \~3 years, I took out \~$150,000 in personal loans and 0% credit card balance transfer loans to purchase 4.75 Bitcoin. I've paid \~$15,000 in interest so far and currently have a \~$40,000 remaining balance. 

Today, June 4th, Bitcoin is trading at $105,000 which brings the current value of my 4.75₿ to $498,750. 

The average price I paid is \~$35,000 per Bitcoin. 

My total cost basis is \~$165,000  ($150k in loans + $15k in interest). 

This comes to \~201% unrealized profit or \~$333,000 in dollar terms. 



**What’s new since my last update?**

I know that for like the past 3 updates I said I wouldn’t take out any more loans, but I lied again! I took out another 0% balance transfer loan for $25,000 to purchase 0.25₿ when Bitcoin hit $100k. 

I was so close to having it all paid off too. I was down to just $20,000 remaining balance, but I simply couldn’t resist.



**What’s next?** 

I have no plans to sell any of it. Just buy and hold. Retire early. I service the debt with earned income from my job. I can easily afford the payments. I should have it all paid off by mid 2026… so long as I don’t take out even more loans to buy even more Bitcoin! 

Also, as mentioned in my 2.5 year update, I paid off all of the personal loans! So no more interest charges accruing. The remaining \~$40,000 I owe is from the balance transfers which have 0% interest for at least the next 6-12 months depending upon the card. I'm sure I'll have them all paid off before then. 

I’ve made updates every \~6 months or so. Feel free to view my post history to learn more about my strategy.



**Most Frequently Asked Questions I get?**



**1. Why take out loans when I could just buy Bitcoin from earned income?** 

If I only did that, then I would not have been able to buy nearly as much Bitcoin as I did at the lowest prices. Back in 2022, I knew we were in a bear market. I also knew that it wouldn’t last more than a couple years. 

I view it as a “Reverse DCA."" I pay the loans each month instead of DCA. This allowed me to buy a lot more Bitcoin than I otherwise would have been able to buy. I can easily afford the monthly payments to service the debt. I borrow responsibly.

If I had just DCA’d these past 3 years, I would have only been able to acquire less than half of what I got from using the loan strategy. The loans allowed me to buy more Bitcoin when the price was in the $16-35K range.

I you’ve been following my updates, you’d know that the majority of my 4.75₿ was purchased from February 2022 to October 2023 when it was in the aforementioned $16-35k range. 

My recent purchase of 0.25₿ for $25,000 was kinda painful to be honest. Especially considering that just 2.5 years ago that much would have gotten me \~1.25₿… big yikes!



**2. This is too risky. You’re insane. You’re gambling. Never take out loans to buy Bitcoin!**

Taking out loans to buy assets is fine, so long as you can afford to responsibly service the debt. Just don’t take out loans to buy liabilities!!! This is what most Americans get wrong. They take out loans to buy liabilities such as vacations, shopping sprees, cars, jewelry, etc…

I have a thesis an a strategy…

My thesis is simple: due to reckless fiscal and monetary policy (money printing) by our government, the US dollar will continue to depreciate in value, i.e. inflation. 

My strategy: take out loans in USD and buy hard money like BTC which will appreciate in value against the USD. 

The strategy is basically a speculative attack on the US dollar. Wall Street traders have been doing the same thing for decades. Have you hear of the Yen Carry Trade? I’m doing the same thing except with USD and BTC.

If you look at all the successful, filthy rich Wall Street investors, you’ll see that they all have one thing in common: they used leverage (borrowing) to buy assets. None of them got rich by working hard, saving money and investing in the S&P500. They all use intelligent leverage and they all concentrate it on a few high conviction assets. 

For myself, I’m not so concerned about becoming filthy rich, I just want to have financial security, independence and sovereignty. This is why I Bitcoin. ",0.9872
2025-06-05,Still holding XMR in Europe- but it’s getting nearly impossible to buy,"I’ve been holding Monero (XMR) for a while now- currently it makes up about 10% of my crypto portfolio. I live in Europe and over the past year it’s become nearly impossible to buy XMR directly with EUR.

Most exchanges have delisted it or disabled EUR/XMR pairs. Even when using a VPN or international account, I still have to buy BTC/USDT and then swap it for XMR via third-party platforms — which adds fees, spreads, and extra steps.

I keep hearing two conflicting arguments about Monero:

**1. Monero is doomed**  
Governments are targeting it, so it’ll get harder to buy/sell, impossible to cash out, and useless for real-world purchases. It can’t scale and it’s being choked off before it can go mainstream.

**2. Monero is working exactly as intended**  
The fact that governments are trying to suppress it *proves* it’s untraceable. Institutions don’t promote it because they can’t control it like BTC. The privacy works — that’s why they hate it.

I’m somewhere in the middle. I’m not expecting huge gains, but I still believe XMR has a role. Why? Because it’s still one of the **only cryptos actually being used to buy things** (like on darknet markets, where privacy matters). As long as it’s being used, there’ll be demand.

2025-06-05,"What do you think is the best long-term investment strategy for BTC? Regular DCA, or timing the market using indicators like the CBBI (or others)?","Hey everyone,
I wanted to share my strategy and mainly get your feedback, your methods, and your projections.

Personally, I’m playing the long game. For the last two cycles, I’ve mostly invested in the top 5 cryptos during the bottom of bear markets — when sentiment is at its lowest and the CBBI (cbbi.info) index is between 0 and 20. Then I start DCA selling as we get close to the cycle top (CBBI > 85). I’m not trying to time the market perfectly — but this approach has worked pretty well for me so far. I also look at a few other indicators to confirm.

Lately though, I’ve been wondering: wouldn’t a simple recurring DCA strategy (like €250/month for 20 years) be just as effective — maybe even better? Less stress, no timing, no indicators to follow... and you end up riding every cycle anyway.

So what’s your method? Smoothed DCA? TA-based entries? Indicator signals? Strategic all-ins?

And most of all… where do you see BTC during the next bear market?
Do you think we’ll really dip under 90k again — or was that level history?

Really curious to hear how you all approach this. Helps me shape my own long-term vision.",0.9731
2025-06-05,This Time Really Is Different,"These are the words one must never utter, becuase as soon as you say them, the market has a way of humbling you, however, it is true, this time is different.  

How different?  That remains to be known, but in some form it is different.  The most obvious example is BTC reached a new ATH before the halving took place in April of 2024, that has never happened before. We also have a lot of institutional adoption like never before, a lot of this happened due to the ETFs that were approved last year. 

I don't even know what to say about Saylor/MSTR, but that one is interesting and this post isn't going to be that long. 

The other thing that is different is how much BTC is concentrated in just a few entities.  Retail is not pumping BTC right now the way they have in the past, which makes this cycle (whatever version of it we are in right now) feel slower. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, it could be a good thing.  Maybe BTC going parabolic is gone, and we will have a more measured, slow uptrend with some minor pullbacks along the way. 

The other part of this that is different is BTC is outperforming QQQ/SPY (stock market).  Now, BTC has outperformed the stockmarket since its insepction in its green years, when it is in an uptrend, but what is different this time, BTC outperformed QQQ/SPY to the downside during this most recent stock market crash where the Nasdaq crashed about 26% with the Trump Tariffs wars (which feel over, or maybe the markets don't care anymore, I'm not sure), BTC crashed about 28% (more or less in line with the Nasdaq), however, it was bought up to be green on the year before the Nasdaq. 

It took the Nasdaq 24 days from its bottom closing price to reach breakeven on the year, vs BTC reached green on the year from its lowest closing price in just 18 days. 

What does this mean if this time really is different?  I haven't a clue, other than all those waiting around for the same pattern to emerge are going to be disappointed as the old pattern has broken.  Doesn't mean there won't be an alt run, or this pattern won't rhyme with what we saw over the previous 4-year cycles. 

One thing seems to be true, Bitcoin has proven time and time again it is king and will have it any other way. ",-0.335

2025-06-06,I went out to eat and accidentally got a girlfriend (I think?),"So I decided to treat myself to some alone time last night—just me, my Ledger Nano X, and a steak medium-rare. Walked into this semi-upscale place downtown. You know the type: Edison bulbs, overpriced tap water, and a menu that has “locally sourced aioli” as a flex.

About halfway through my grilled branzino, the waitress—Amanda (I clocked the name tag instantly, important detail)—comes by and says, “Can I get you anything else?”

Now, I don’t know if it was the tone of her voice or the way she slightly leaned in to place my water down, but something in her energy shifted. The eye contact lasted maybe a second longer than usual. I could feel it. She was vibing.

I gave her a soft chuckle and replied, “Just your smile is enough.” (Smooth. Didn’t plan that. Just alpha instincts.)

She smiled back (probably out of instinct), and I knew then and there—this was it. This was our moment. Amanda and I. Chapter One.

Now, as someone who’s made significant moves in Ripple and VeChain, I know how to seize opportunity. And rather than leaving a normie tip like cash, I decided to change her life.

So I pull out a folded paper from my crypto journal (always keep a few on me just in case fate strikes), and on it I write:

“Thank you, Amanda 😊
You made this meal unforgettable.
Here’s a tip worth holding onto.
	•	@yuppienetwork1996”

Beneath it: a QR code to a cold wallet holding exactly 5.0 XRP. And in the TX memo, just in case she looks, I added:
“Dinner was lovely. Text me.” + my number.

But I wasn’t done. I left the paper sticking out of the checkbook just enough for her to see the words “Digital Asset Enclosed” in bold Century Gothic.

As I walked out, I imagined her discovering my main wallet, scanning the code in awe, seeing my 0.25 BTC (in mostly Ripple, obviously) holdings, and realizing: this isn’t just a customer… this is a man of decentralized conviction.

I haven’t heard from her yet, but it’s only been 14 hours. These things take time. True love isn’t always instant.

Anyway, going back tonight. Might tip in VeChain this time.",0.995

I’m in an XRP subreddit, and it’s pure madness it feels like a cult. I genuinely want to understand if XRP has any real potential.

So, is there anything that could actually drive XRP’s value up someday? If so, what? I constantly see positive news around XRP, yet the price drops instead of rising. Sure, there’s heavy market manipulation, and whales keep liquidating small holders, but it’s still weird. It’s as if the market reacts negatively to developments, signaling disapproval of XRP’s direction.

i know making a post about Nano on this subreddit will get me a lot of downvotes and a lot of you will come with shorty snarky comments calling me a shill, calling nano a shitcoin and saying its dead because of the price charty.  
  
 I hope some of you will still come with more constructive critizisme and elaborate further on why you don't like Nano, instead of short low effort comments.

when i look at nano, i see instant transactions and no fees. which seems good for an actual currency. i know it had that big spam attack a few years ago but from what i read its better now. so people saying its bad because of spam seems like old news.

i also hear people bring up the bitgrail hack all the time. but that was the exchange that got hacked, not the nano network itself, right? and the exchange was found to be at fault. so why is that still a reason to hate on the coin today?

so i want to ask you guys directly. what specific feature or problem with nano makes you hate it or think it's a bad project? is it the tech? the block-lattice thing? the lack of smart contracts? is it not secure enough compared to something like bitcoin?

i'm not trying to shill, im trying to learn the real reasons for the negative feelings towards it. it seems like it does what a currency should do really well, so i must be missing something big.

2025-06-07,Michael Saylor downplays quantum-risks to Bitcoin,"Michael Saylor gave an interview in which he was asked about the potential risks that quantum computers could pose to Bitcoin.

Stating „If in 10-20 years there is a hyperpowerful computer that threatens modern cryptography the answer is network, hardware and software upgrades“, he completely neglects the fact that his so-called „modern“ cryptography such as ECDSA will be long-obsolete by then as per NIST, which advises to decommission this algorithm by 2030 latest and replace it by a quantum-resistant counterpart.

He also states that Bitcoin „will just upgrade its software“ as Microsoft and Google will when it’s time, but disregards that it’s way harder to upgrade for Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature, where consensus has to be agreed on first. Especially concerning the major question of how to handle legacy addresses, whose public keys have been exposed, making them vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful quantum computer in the future. All that while Google and Apple are proactively implementing the new quantum-safe NIST-approved algorithms already.

Him saying „It‘s the hardest thing in the universe to hack“ just gives me „The titanic cannot be sunk“ kind of vibes. And saying it’s encryption is stronger than Google is just a straight-up lie.

I can’t imagine he is not aware of all this, which makes me really question his authenticity in the Bitcoin community. It should be in his interest to make Bitcoin future-proof in order to secure the protocol and its investors. And he, as the face of Bitcoin, should take the leading role in ensuring that Bitcoin will reach its goal to be the future store-of-value and replace gold instead of downplaying potential future threats.",0.7546

1 Some of these posters are saying why would I invest if im in debt. Most people are in debt (car payments, mortgage,etc) this is why we invest to change our situation. Im not broke by any means. I just think my money could work more for me if its not sitting in alt coins collecting dust.

2 Some of you lost your mind when I mentioned Trump. Hes not the main reason I'm backing off but crypto has gone to shit since he got involved. If you can't see that you are blind or not paying attention.

2025-06-09,FOMC: Polymarket users predict a 98% chance that the Fed will not make any rate cut changes on June 18 - Bullish Signal for Crypto?,"Just crossed with this [Tweet ](https://x.com/thomson_coz/status/1931956917938888914)talking about rate cuts prediction

Looks like according to prediction market Polymarket, an app in Polygon, there is now a 98% chance that the Fed will hold interest rates steady on June 18. No cuts, no hikes, just vibes and hawkish patience.

Now, how this could affect Ethereum and the rest of the crypto space? Well, no rate cuts is equivalent to no panic and less volatility. Markets hate surprises. If the Fed stays put, it confirms what investors already priced in which creates a more stable macro backdrop.

Furthermore, ETH loves predictability. With Ethereum ETFs out there it should be enough caffeine. A non event FOMC means institutional money can keep flowing in without fear of sudden macro shocks. Less macro drama is equal to more focus on fundamentals and ETH narratives.

Even if we are not getting cuts yet, just knowing the Fed is not tightening the screws further keeps risk appetite alive. That is good for ETH, altcoins and DeFi and pretty much everything that lives on chain.

But we don't have to forget that all of this can drastically with other events. We don't have to forget that today China and US have a meeting regarding tariffs in London. Furthermore, even if it is funny, Trump is going to have a call with Elon that could trigger something in the market too. Everything sums up.

What are your plays heading into June 18?

2025-06-10,"Why are people still bullish on projects like Nano and Cardano, which are lauded for qualities they've had for nearly a decade, yet those qualities have led to near zero traction or adoption in that time?","*Disclaimer: Not trying to FUD ADA or XNO, they are just the best examples of this thinking that I've noticed. Nothing against them, except I personally wouldn't invest in them at this point. If you disagree, this is the perfect opportunity to shill them, but if the shills are anything like the examples I've made below, I'd save em.*

**tldr: Cardano and Nano are both lauded for qualities they've possessed for many years, despite that they have both languished over those same years, so why would anyone expect them to positively change course now after nearly a decade of this? And at what point do you admit your investment thesis was wrong?**

In 2017-18, I understood the hype around them at that point. They, along with other projects, were promising alternatives to Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc. They both had strong communities around them, as well as new tech stacks that were different and exciting.

But now in 2025, after a handful of years, what positive changes have we seen from them relative to the industry? What indication do we see that they are on the right track?

Both have seen numerous protocol upgrades... but every protocol has as well, this is expected out of any project and not really a selling point in most cases. ""Building through the bear market"" is not a badge of honor, it's table stakes.

Beyond that, None of them have found anything resembling product market fit or any sustainable usage. Both of them are largely the same as they were before. Or at least they are being used almost in the entirely same manner and to the same degree. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry started to adopt defi, stablecoin payments, and new tech stacks. Stablecoins became the killer app of crypto and the trojan horse of the RWA trend. Sub-second block times and sub-cent fees became the new goal for any chain.

It kind of feels like this:

---

* Past Nano Shill: it's fast and free! A vastly cheaper and faster alternative to the few blockchains people use today, saving minutes and maybe hundreds of dollars of fees. Most people are just buying and selling or sending A to B, so why not use Nano?

* Current Nano Shill: it's fast and free! A marginally cheaper and faster alternative to the the most popular blockchains people use today, saving maybe a fraction of a second or up to a few seconds and saving a fraction of a penny up to a few cents. But you can't send stablecoins through it... or any other assets... and there is no defi.

---

* Past Cardano Shill: It uses eutxo, it uses Haskell, it's so secure, it's so decentralized, it has ETH's co-founder. It's gonna take off when smart contracts launch!

* Current Cardano Shill: It uses eutxo, it uses Haskell, it's so secure, it's so decentralized, it has ETH's co-founder and it has smart contracts. It's gonna take off when Leios/Midgard/Hydra/btcOS/QuantumHosky/onchaingovernance/WhateverTheNextHypedUnderwhelmingThingIs. Stablecoins? Umm sort of. Defi? Sort of. Is it fast or cheap? Faster and cheaper than ETHL1, but slower and more expensive than most of the rest.

---

So the selling points are largely the same for both projects, but the industry around them have passed them by and neither of them have found footing in any of the emerging niches. Nano is a payment coin but the most popular payment coins are overwhelming stables and Cardano has had it's own troubles courting stablecoins. Some people act like they don't want them, but to be a general purpose smart contract platform at this point without them, is asking for disaster. Beyond that we're actually seeing heavy usage of a handful of chains. Ethereum is *barely* inflationary at this point with the fees being burnt, Solana is doing hundreds, if not thousands, of TPS and keeping fees lower than Cardano, doing single digit TPS. So it's not just like the market is purely based on hype like it has been in the past, we actually have projects with real usage and revenue.

So, the way I see it is both Cardano and Nano are on a slow road to irrelevance unless something changes. Whenever they are spoken about positively, it's almost *always* about a quality that they have possessed for many years, and rarely if ever is it anything it's currently doing. And if it's had those qualities that you think are so great, for so many years, then at what point do those qualities actually materialize something beneficial like actual demand/usage? At what point do you resign to the idea that you might have overvalued those things? And if you're going to respond with something as reductive as ""the market just hasn't realized it yet"" then at least try to explain how that could possibly happen, as if this subreddit possesses research capabilities beyond what the public can fathom...",0.9981

2025-06-11,How Soon Will Bitcoin Starts Hosting Real dApps,"It’s wild how we’re still struggling with Bitcoin’s speed and fees in 2025. Like, we’ve had Lightning Network for years, and while it works for small transactions, it’s far from ideal for building anything beyond simple payments. 

Meanwhile, chains like Solana, Avalanche, and even Base are moving fast with dApps, DeFi, NFTs... all the stuff that brings real user interaction and liquidity.

We in the Bitcoin community might hate to admit it, but we need more than store-of-value if BTC wants to stay relevant beyond ETFs and HODLers. 

Projects like Stacks and Rootstock have been trying to bridge the gap and are doing relatively well, but they haven't cracked it yet i believe...

There’s some quiet buzz about a Bitcoin-native Layer 2, B2, using ZK-Rollups and EVM compatibility claiming 300x faster and 50x cheaper txs. 

It’s building on top of BTC, not around it. That’s interesting. Especially if it plays nice with Taproot and offers cross-chain functionality.

Sentiment is still mixed, but if it catches fire, this could shake up the BTC narrative since its native token $B2 is already listed on CEXs like Bitget and others...

If Bitcoin starts hosting real dApps, that’s going to shift liquidity and attention in ways traders can’t ignore.

2025-06-11,Copy trading,"So I have been copy trading this guy on blofin for a little while now and he had been making decent profit every now and then shorting some alts and meme coins, small bits every time. I was happy with the small profits but now a day or 3 ago he started taking lots of short positions against VVV and Kaia, even some on BTC and ETH some of which have been closed already in a small profit. 

Now I myself am not the best trader and am not familiar at all with Kaia or VVV. In total all of the trades are in a loss for about 50% of my account balance (down to 190$ from a bit under 400). All of the losing short trades are currently still open and I was thinking about closing them manually yesterday, but off course I didn't. Thinking maybe he knows something that I don't. Now off course today they are even more down. 

So now my question is what would you guys do? Should I cut my losses or do you guys think these coins are gonna go down again? I'm thinking about just leaving it open. Losing the rest of the account would not be a massive deal to me, but personally I just don't see it ending well if I do keep them open. Have a bad feeling the acc is going to 0.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Last year, I’ve invented a way to hack financial markets because I’ve lost a job and tried to find a way to make money.

I’ve been watching the 1s graphs on lots of coins and I understood the correlation between everything (to sum it up - everything moves because of human greed)

Because this hack allows me to manipulate any asset, I literally went mad, because I was feeling like a king (was yelling at everybody and acting like a king) and I was saying I was touched by God, before starting to say I’m a God himself (because all markets followed my actions)

Thankfully, my wife is a doctor and she put me into a mental hospital before it’s too late, and I’ve had to spent a while to sort out my brain because of this huge “psychosis”.

After I got better, I’ve tried this “attack” again and again to prove myself (essentially I manipulate the markets when I’m too manic) and after realizing that what I invented is true I’ve started to contact everyone including SEC and FBI but for obvious reasons nobody believes me.

That’s why I’m selling this information for 10 000 BTC to hype on the price (I need 2 pizzas) as I am the best hacker in the world.

I will use pretty much all of it (99%) on charity (but it won’t make much sense after everyone realize what really happens in the world as hopefully a lot of things gonna be fixed anyway)

It doesn't come as a surprise that BNB led in overall return, I think the surprise for me is the fact that BGB had the highest farming rewards, which made up over 60% of its total profit, so that's something to look at especially for people looking for more profit options. 

 Moving on from these two, I noticed that OKB gave no farming rewards but the total profit made isn't that bad, but MNT and GT underperformed both in price and total value. Surprisingly though MNT offered the second highest farming reward, but that wasn’t even enough to offset the price drop.

I think generally it has a lot to with stuffs happening with these exchanges behind the scenes, and it's probably why BNB and even BGB did very well, especially with the impressive price action with BGB in recent time. But all this to say, exchange tokens might also be a good option for profits especially when selected carefully. 

For comparison BTC did about 10% within this time. ",0.9922

2025-06-14,Best wallet for simple occasional purchases of BTC?,"Hey y'all, I'm a newbie to crypto. I had a wallet with Celcius years ago, and lost everything when they froze all accounts and filed for bankruptcy. I attempted to recover it all in the class action suit, but never recieved what I was owed despite contacting them relentlessly. 

Basically, I want to make some BTC purchases here and there as an investment. Nothing crazy, I just want somewhere SECURE to hold some crypto. I feel so burned and traumatized from my experience with Celsius, so longevity is really important to me here. 

Should I just be using PayPal or something?

2025-06-15,Some 'Alternative' info and thoughts about 'Alt'coins,"1. If BTC could absorb the marketcap of ALL the coins except for the top 10, it would increase... only 20%.  The idea that altcoins hurt BTC is likely false.  Competition is healthy- it means there is demand.  So we can relax, altcoins aren't ruining your investment.

2. There are not 17M + ""alt"" coins.  Those are mostly memecoins or very specific use case driven projects leveraging blockchain concepts.  

3. As noted in the first bullet, 80% of the value is still in the top 10.  After about the top 1000, the value isn't worth talking about.  

  
4. If we have decided BTC is the store of value, then it's fair to say many of the top 100 are more prepared to serve as a payment system, or deliver a business specific use case.  This means they aren't an alternative to BTC, and they aren't competing for the same marketshare.    
  
5. Smart contracts are an ""alternative"" concept- the added value to blockchain continues to evolve.  If this proves to be valuable enough within a store of value use case, then perhaps that is an ""altcoin"" directly competing with BTC.

6. ""Altseason"" 4 years ago mostly applied to ethereum and new coins.  Now we have a wide variety of alts in the top 1000, all in different stages earning marketshare.  Many top coins have higher marketcaps, so achieving 10x or more from those levels does seem challenging.  New coins face competition, and much greater scrutiny, so the percentage that breakout will not match the last cycle.

7. Higher Marketcaps? This doesn't mean they are sitting near all time highs - some are though!  It means many are sitting at higher lows than 4 years ago.  Btw, if you are achieving higher lows, that does not mean you are disappearing, that means you are growing.  A common talking point is these projects are disappearing, which simply is not true. 

8. Calling any alt a ""shitcoin"" is a pathetic attack which ignores the potential value of using the technology.  Just a reminder, they are building upon the same concepts BTC leverages.  More folks believing in blockchain tech strengthens the space, including BTC.  It would be good to see open discussion again about what is being achieved with the mindset that not everything is a threat to your investment.

In summary- while the narratives attack altcoins, they really aren't hurting BTC investments.  There is a variety of market opportunity that BTC is not suited for.  Investing in altcoins is more challenging than 4 years ago- choosing from old and new, big and small.  But it is healthy and positive for the space overall if investment continues.  ",0.977
2025-06-15,Where are people buying BTC and transferring it to a wallet at a low cost?,"I have primarily bought altcoins the past 4 years but I want to start DCAing into BTC. I had started in 2021 but then stopped and I’m seeing that’s a mistake. 

What would people recommend to buy BTC for cheap transfer over to something like a ledger. I currently don’t have ledger I’ve used cold wallets to hold my alts but I want a hard wallet for my BTC. Or do platforms like ledger let you buy BTC directly on their platform?

I could buy the spot ETF but I want control over my own stuff. I don’t need blackrock using me to manipulate markets.

2025-06-16,Bitcoin Buying Timing: War Fears and Market Recovery Analysis,"The market has been rattled once more by rising tensions between Iran and Israel. This news was enough to shake the entire asset market, including cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin briefly threatening the $100,000 mark and altcoins facing steep corrections. It’s a familiar scene—one of recurring fear and doubt. But what does it all truly mean?

Looking back, similar conflicts unfolded in April and October 2024. The market reacted with momentary panic and a surge in selling, only to recover swiftly within days. This time appears no different. **The fact that fear hasn’t lingered long suggests this is less a structural collapse and more a technical reaction.** It’s a clue that there’s more to this than just a price drop—something worth examining beneath the surface.

The Iran-Israel conflict has been limited to strategic airstrikes and restrained missile responses, without direct ground confrontation. This points to a localized skirmish rather than an all-out war, likely acting as an event that pauses the market’s existing rhythm rather than redefining its course. In other words, this uncertainty may fade within days rather than persist.

**This hints that, between collapse and counterattack, the latter is gaining traction**. Meanwhile, Ethereum is showing striking momentum, with trading volume and futures open interest hitting all-time highs, suggesting not just a technical bounce but a structural signal of institutional entry.

The ETH/BTC ratio further confirms Ethereum’s relative strength, **shifting focus from short-term price swings to the potential for a broader transition.**

The altcoin market tells a bigger story. The OTHERS market cap chart shows it breaking out of a months-long downtrend, now digesting consolidation in the Phase D zone. If this level holds, a return to an upward cycle seems plausible.

**This isn’t a mere bearish turn but a retest of the upper boundary of the prior downtrend channel—a technical validation of support.**

The TOTAL3 index reinforces this, with the altcoin market’s cycle of surge, correction, support confirmation, and rebreakout still intact, currently poised for its next expansion.

Amid this, Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 marks a symbolic shift. It’s not just a stock update—it’s a structural milestone for the cryptocurrency industry crossing into mainstream acceptance. Wall Street no longer sees digital assets as outliers but as candidates for integration. The door to institutionalization is opening.

Ripple, meanwhile, has been quietly consolidating in a box range for 195 days. This prolonged stagnation could precede an explosive breakout in either direction, with the 2.08 level acting as a key support that, if held, might serve as a buying point.

Ultimately, the market is swaying in uncertainty, but that uncertainty could fuel the next move. The pattern of war, fear, correction, and rebound has repeated through 2024 and now into June 2025. History suggests these dips often recover quickly, laying the groundwork for fresh rallies. Rather than being paralyzed by fear, it might be worth reading the structure of the flow and preparing for what’s next. Opportunities don’t come often, but when they do, they’re brief and potent.

2025-06-16,"Right now, BTC is caught between FOMO and fear. The market is bullish — but the world isn’t exactly stable.","On one hand, we’ve got solid bullish signals:  
• SharpLink Gaming just bought $463 million worth of ETH, becoming the largest public ETH holder.  
• Anthony Pompliano is reportedly raising $750 million via a SPAC to buy Bitcoin. Yes, *that* Pompliano — the one who was calling for $500K BTC during the bear market.  
• BTC hit $110,000 last Tuesday — almost breaking its ATH of $111,940 from May 22.

— On the other hand, the macro picture isn't so pretty:  
• Israeli airstrikes on Iran sent BTC down 2.8% in 90 minutes. They can crash BTC at any moment, all it takes is another hit.  
• Last time, $427 million in long positions got wiped out. Bulls took a hit, fast.

# So, can BTC still reach $119,000 in this climate?

Personally, I’m cautiously optimistic.

✓ The fundamentals are strong: institutional adoption, post-halving supply tightening, growing ETF demand, and now SPACs targeting BTC.  
✗ But short-term moves are still dictated by geopolitics. And that’s not something even the whales can control.

So yes, $119K is possible — but timing it depends more on global stability than TA.

# What about Ethereum?

ETH is quietly building up momentum too:  
• SharpLink staked over 95% of its ETH — that’s a long-term move, not just speculation.  
• If this continues, a return to $4,000 feels realistic. Not immediate, but definitely in sight — especially if the SEC eases up.

What do you think?  
• Can BTC still hit $119K this year?  
• Are we underestimating the impact of war and instability?  
• Should ETH be getting more attention right now?
