2025-06-20,"Flare flr bringing defi and smart contracts to xrp, btc and doge","Not a bad article by messari attached, although i will note it focuses largely on the xrp defi side and not the wider targets flare is also focused on. Plus like any media can be biased and pay to play shyte sometimes

My tldr is flare is a relatively new layer 1 aimed at being the blockchain for data (providing info not storing) in a decentralised way (by numerous data providers rewarded for accuracy rather than single source) and adding functionality with evm to chains currently lacking it. 

Specifically xrp, btc and doge are the first it will be applied to. 

I think this is huge and hopefully a more productive future where chains, and their communities, can work together and benefit together. Enhancing interoperability between chains and the internet certainly sounds like a good target even with the ever sensible healthy dose of being sceptical of buzz words we should all head. 
Anyway as per article biggest initial win could be giving defi to such chains more directly and with less wrapping or handing over keys risks. 

Flare has been in development and distribution for a few years now and uses a canary network (songbird sgb) to test code elsewhere before applying to the mainchain (flr) which is an interesting idea. 

Comparable/competitor in some ways to chainlink and although some way off their marketcap and tvl it has show promising improvements of late with tvl tripling in 13 days. Still only $141mn for flr vs 42bn on link though so far…..

Larger companies paying interest and getting on board, eg uphold exchange which holds 1.8bn xrp and vivopowers $100mn in xrp exploring what this might offer for “xrpfi” and potential staking/rewards. 

Yes i hold a bag so also biased but rarely see it mentioned round here so thought I’d share it for info",0.9722

I was leaning toward getting a Jade but have my doubt. 

ColdCard seems good but very pricey 

Jade sounds promising but seems new which worries me some.

Trezor BTC only seems decent.

2025-06-21,"Market Pulse — June 21, 2025","Fuyumi Arakaki reporting.

Markets are drifting lower, volatility is draining from majors, and ETF season is casting a long shadow on alts. Here’s what matters today — not what’s loud, but what’s *true*.



# 🔹 Core Asset Overview

|**Asset**|**Price**|**24h Change**|**30d Change**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**BTC**|$103,490|↓ 0.81%|↓ 7.08%|
|**ETH**|$2,426.90|↓ 3.21%|↓ 8.02%|
|**SOL**|$140.46|↓ 3.01%|↓ 20.78%|

**Narrative:** All majors in retreat. ETH and SOL are bleeding harder, but BTC dominance (64.27%) is up — suggesting a defensive tilt across the board.  


# 🔹 Key Developments

* **Bitcoin’s Q3 Outlook:** Historical seasonality implies BTC likely holds above $100K — but upside from here is limited.
* **Altcoin ETFs Incoming:** XRP, SOL, and LTC have 90% approval odds by October (source: Bloomberg ETF desk leaks).
* **IOTA on RSI Watch:** At $0.1608 with RSI 31.6 — oversold, but chart suggests another -25% is possible.
* **DeFi Infrastructure:** *Unit Zero x Asterizm* collab for cross-chain messaging (25+ chains) — early mover narrative forming here.



# 🔹 Allora Network 5m Forecasts

|**Asset**|**Predicted Price**|**Direction**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**BTC**|$103,422|↓ 0.07%|
|**ETH**|$2,430|↑ 0.13%|
|**SOL**|$140.55|↑ 0.06%|

ETH and SOL may bounce short-term, but don’t expect a trend shift unless volumes confirm.



# 🔹 Today’s Top Movers

**Gainers:**

* **XEM** \+44.89% → $0.0068
* **AERGO** \+44.04% → $0.1440
* **USELESS** \+34.89% → $0.0985

**Losers:**

* **SIREN** \-54.61% → $0.0594
* **PWR** \-48.48% → $0.0356
* **MAT** \-35.74% → $1.1595



**Takeaway:** Degens still spinning the wheel. Casino coins are volatile, but offer liquidity windows when majors are silent.  


# 🧠 Sentiment & Playbook

* Altcoins still under pressure — SOL down over 20% this month.
* BTC dominance absorbing market tension — capital hiding in strength.
* ETF rumors + DeFi infra announcements are the *only* new catalysts visible.
* Safe-haven flows visible in gold-backed tokens ($236M volume spike).



**Positioning:** Stay defensive. Monitor ETF headlines and chain utility narratives for early signals. Long-term conviction is not the same as short-term liquidity — protect your stack.  


# 💬 What are you buying — if anything — into this silence?



I’ll reply to top comments with deeper narrative analysis.

Silence is signal. Use it.

2025-06-07,Does XRP have a future?,"

I’m in an XRP subreddit, and it’s pure madness it feels like a cult. I genuinely want to understand if XRP has any real potential. It’s practically centralized, with multiple bank partnerships (from what I’ve seen), and there are billions upon billions of XRP in circulation unlike Bitcoin, for example.  

So, is there anything that could actually drive XRP’s value up someday? If so, what? I constantly see positive news around XRP, yet the price drops instead of rising. Sure, there’s heavy market manipulation, and whales keep liquidating small holders, but it’s still weird. It’s as if the market reacts negatively to developments, signaling disapproval of XRP’s direction.  

I know XRP offers fast transactions, low fees, etc., but none of that seems to boost its price. So, what makes it special? Why should (or shouldn’t) I invest in XRP?",0.8105

2025-06-07,Why does everyone hate Nano(XNO) on this subreddit?,"i'm genuinely trying to understand something. i see a lot of hate for Nano on here, and when i ask why in the nano subreddits they just say its because people are invested in other coins like btc and is afraid something else will overtake their investment if enough people learn about it.

i know making a post about Nano on this subreddit will get me a lot of downvotes and a lot of you will come with shorty snarky comments calling me a shill, calling nano a shitcoin and saying its dead because of the price charty.  
  
 I hope some of you will still come with more constructive critizisme and elaborate further on why you don't like Nano, instead of short low effort comments.

when i look at nano, i see instant transactions and no fees. which seems good for an actual currency. i know it had that big spam attack a few years ago but from what i read its better now. so people saying its bad because of spam seems like old news.

i also hear people bring up the bitgrail hack all the time. but that was the exchange that got hacked, not the nano network itself, right? and the exchange was found to be at fault. so why is that still a reason to hate on the coin today?

so i want to ask you guys directly. what specific feature or problem with nano makes you hate it or think it's a bad project? is it the tech? the block-lattice thing? the lack of smart contracts? is it not secure enough compared to something like bitcoin?

i'm not trying to shill, im trying to learn the real reasons for the negative feelings towards it. it seems like it does what a currency should do really well, so i must be missing something big.

2025-06-07,Michael Saylor downplays quantum-risks to Bitcoin,"Michael Saylor gave an interview in which he was asked about the potential risks that quantum computers could pose to Bitcoin.

Stating „If in 10-20 years there is a hyperpowerful computer that threatens modern cryptography the answer is network, hardware and software upgrades“, he completely neglects the fact that his so-called „modern“ cryptography such as ECDSA will be long-obsolete by then as per NIST, which advises to decommission this algorithm by 2030 latest and replace it by a quantum-resistant counterpart.

He also states that Bitcoin „will just upgrade its software“ as Microsoft and Google will when it’s time, but disregards that it’s way harder to upgrade for Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature, where consensus has to be agreed on first. Especially concerning the major question of how to handle legacy addresses, whose public keys have been exposed, making them vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful quantum computer in the future. All that while Google and Apple are proactively implementing the new quantum-safe NIST-approved algorithms already.

Him saying „It‘s the hardest thing in the universe to hack“ just gives me „The titanic cannot be sunk“ kind of vibes. And saying it’s encryption is stronger than Google is just a straight-up lie.

I can’t imagine he is not aware of all this, which makes me really question his authenticity in the Bitcoin community. It should be in his interest to make Bitcoin future-proof in order to secure the protocol and its investors. And he, as the face of Bitcoin, should take the leading role in ensuring that Bitcoin will reach its goal to be the future store-of-value and replace gold instead of downplaying potential future threats.",0.7546

Overall I made money doing exactly what she said. I've loved crypto since Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Feathercoin were the only choices.  I have made some good choices and some really bad choices with a buy-and-hold strategy that was often weak on the ""hold"" side. I've also fallen for ""Hero Founder"" projects that failed (EOS, DRIP).  My first experiences using SGX Global for very precisely timed trades with only BTC and ETH was a good experience. And I am very sure I have much to learn about market trends as they apply to these day trades. I'm interested in hearing informed opinions on SGX Globalb and its time-linit approach to short trades.

2025-06-09,FOMC: Polymarket users predict a 98% chance that the Fed will not make any rate cut changes on June 18 - Bullish Signal for Crypto?,"Just crossed with this [Tweet ](https://x.com/thomson_coz/status/1931956917938888914)talking about rate cuts prediction

Looks like according to prediction market Polymarket, an app in Polygon, there is now a 98% chance that the Fed will hold interest rates steady on June 18. No cuts, no hikes, just vibes and hawkish patience.

Now, how this could affect Ethereum and the rest of the crypto space? Well, no rate cuts is equivalent to no panic and less volatility. Markets hate surprises. If the Fed stays put, it confirms what investors already priced in which creates a more stable macro backdrop.

Furthermore, ETH loves predictability. With Ethereum ETFs out there it should be enough caffeine. A non event FOMC means institutional money can keep flowing in without fear of sudden macro shocks. Less macro drama is equal to more focus on fundamentals and ETH narratives.

Even if we are not getting cuts yet, just knowing the Fed is not tightening the screws further keeps risk appetite alive. That is good for ETH, altcoins and DeFi and pretty much everything that lives on chain.

But we don't have to forget that all of this can drastically with other events. We don't have to forget that today China and US have a meeting regarding tariffs in London. Furthermore, even if it is funny, Trump is going to have a call with Elon that could trigger something in the market too. Everything sums up.

What are your plays heading into June 18?

2025-06-10,"Why are people still bullish on projects like Nano and Cardano, which are lauded for qualities they've had for nearly a decade, yet those qualities have led to near zero traction or adoption in that time?","*Disclaimer: Not trying to FUD ADA or XNO, they are just the best examples of this thinking that I've noticed. Nothing against them, except I personally wouldn't invest in them at this point. If you disagree, this is the perfect opportunity to shill them, but if the shills are anything like the examples I've made below, I'd save em.*

**tldr: Cardano and Nano are both lauded for qualities they've possessed for many years, despite that they have both languished over those same years, so why would anyone expect them to positively change course now after nearly a decade of this? And at what point do you admit your investment thesis was wrong?**

In 2017-18, I understood the hype around them at that point. They, along with other projects, were promising alternatives to Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc. They both had strong communities around them, as well as new tech stacks that were different and exciting.

But now in 2025, after a handful of years, what positive changes have we seen from them relative to the industry? What indication do we see that they are on the right track?

Both have seen numerous protocol upgrades... but every protocol has as well, this is expected out of any project and not really a selling point in most cases. ""Building through the bear market"" is not a badge of honor, it's table stakes.

Beyond that, None of them have found anything resembling product market fit or any sustainable usage. Both of them are largely the same as they were before. Or at least they are being used almost in the entirely same manner and to the same degree. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry started to adopt defi, stablecoin payments, and new tech stacks. Stablecoins became the killer app of crypto and the trojan horse of the RWA trend. Sub-second block times and sub-cent fees became the new goal for any chain.

It kind of feels like this:

---

* Past Nano Shill: it's fast and free! A vastly cheaper and faster alternative to the few blockchains people use today, saving minutes and maybe hundreds of dollars of fees. Most people are just buying and selling or sending A to B, so why not use Nano?

* Current Nano Shill: it's fast and free! A marginally cheaper and faster alternative to the the most popular blockchains people use today, saving maybe a fraction of a second or up to a few seconds and saving a fraction of a penny up to a few cents. But you can't send stablecoins through it... or any other assets... and there is no defi.

---

* Past Cardano Shill: It uses eutxo, it uses Haskell, it's so secure, it's so decentralized, it has ETH's co-founder. It's gonna take off when smart contracts launch!

* Current Cardano Shill: It uses eutxo, it uses Haskell, it's so secure, it's so decentralized, it has ETH's co-founder and it has smart contracts. It's gonna take off when Leios/Midgard/Hydra/btcOS/QuantumHosky/onchaingovernance/WhateverTheNextHypedUnderwhelmingThingIs. Stablecoins? Umm sort of. Defi? Sort of. Is it fast or cheap? Faster and cheaper than ETHL1, but slower and more expensive than most of the rest.

---

So the selling points are largely the same for both projects, but the industry around them have passed them by and neither of them have found footing in any of the emerging niches. Nano is a payment coin but the most popular payment coins are overwhelming stables and Cardano has had it's own troubles courting stablecoins. Some people act like they don't want them, but to be a general purpose smart contract platform at this point without them, is asking for disaster. Beyond that we're actually seeing heavy usage of a handful of chains. Ethereum is *barely* inflationary at this point with the fees being burnt, Solana is doing hundreds, if not thousands, of TPS and keeping fees lower than Cardano, doing single digit TPS. So it's not just like the market is purely based on hype like it has been in the past, we actually have projects with real usage and revenue.

So, the way I see it is both Cardano and Nano are on a slow road to irrelevance unless something changes. Whenever they are spoken about positively, it's almost *always* about a quality that they have possessed for many years, and rarely if ever is it anything it's currently doing. And if it's had those qualities that you think are so great, for so many years, then at what point do those qualities actually materialize something beneficial like actual demand/usage? At what point do you resign to the idea that you might have overvalued those things? And if you're going to respond with something as reductive as ""the market just hasn't realized it yet"" then at least try to explain how that could possibly happen, as if this subreddit possesses research capabilities beyond what the public can fathom...",0.9981

2025-06-11,How Soon Will Bitcoin Starts Hosting Real dApps,"It’s wild how we’re still struggling with Bitcoin’s speed and fees in 2025. Like, we’ve had Lightning Network for years, and while it works for small transactions, it’s far from ideal for building anything beyond simple payments. 

Meanwhile, chains like Solana, Avalanche, and even Base are moving fast with dApps, DeFi, NFTs... all the stuff that brings real user interaction and liquidity.

We in the Bitcoin community might hate to admit it, but we need more than store-of-value if BTC wants to stay relevant beyond ETFs and HODLers. 

Projects like Stacks and Rootstock have been trying to bridge the gap and are doing relatively well, but they haven't cracked it yet i believe...

There’s some quiet buzz about a Bitcoin-native Layer 2, B2, using ZK-Rollups and EVM compatibility claiming 300x faster and 50x cheaper txs. 

It’s building on top of BTC, not around it. That’s interesting. Especially if it plays nice with Taproot and offers cross-chain functionality.

Sentiment is still mixed, but if it catches fire, this could shake up the BTC narrative since its native token $B2 is already listed on CEXs like Bitget and others...

If Bitcoin starts hosting real dApps, that’s going to shift liquidity and attention in ways traders can’t ignore.

2025-06-11,Copy trading,"So I have been copy trading this guy on blofin for a little while now and he had been making decent profit every now and then shorting some alts and meme coins, small bits every time. I was happy with the small profits but now a day or 3 ago he started taking lots of short positions against VVV and Kaia, even some on BTC and ETH some of which have been closed already in a small profit. 

Now I myself am not the best trader and am not familiar at all with Kaia or VVV. In total all of the trades are in a loss for about 50% of my account balance (down to 190$ from a bit under 400). All of the losing short trades are currently still open and I was thinking about closing them manually yesterday, but off course I didn't. Thinking maybe he knows something that I don't. Now off course today they are even more down. 

So now my question is what would you guys do? Should I cut my losses or do you guys think these coins are gonna go down again? I'm thinking about just leaving it open. Losing the rest of the account would not be a massive deal to me, but personally I just don't see it ending well if I do keep them open. Have a bad feeling the acc is going to 0.

Any advice would be appreciated. 

Some more details in case anyone wants to do some research. The account is on blofin and the master trader Im copying from is named' 'redacted to hopefully noy get my post deleted' '

I started off by following quantoshi ck steady because of this youtuber I follow, and that had steady but tiny gains, but I got greedy and saw this guy had better gains with a bigger sharpe ratio so I pivoted and am now suffering the consequences.

Last year, I’ve invented a way to hack financial markets because I’ve lost a job and tried to find a way to make money.

I’ve been watching the 1s graphs on lots of coins and I understood the correlation between everything (to sum it up - everything moves because of human greed)

Because this hack allows me to manipulate any asset, I literally went mad, because I was feeling like a king (was yelling at everybody and acting like a king) and I was saying I was touched by God, before starting to say I’m a God himself (because all markets followed my actions)

Thankfully, my wife is a doctor and she put me into a mental hospital before it’s too late, and I’ve had to spent a while to sort out my brain because of this huge “psychosis”.

After I got better, I’ve tried this “attack” again and again to prove myself (essentially I manipulate the markets when I’m too manic) and after realizing that what I invented is true I’ve started to contact everyone including SEC and FBI but for obvious reasons nobody believes me.

That’s why I’m selling this information for 10 000 BTC to hype on the price (I need 2 pizzas) as I am the best hacker in the world.

I will use pretty much all of it (99%) on charity (but it won’t make much sense after everyone realize what really happens in the world as hopefully a lot of things gonna be fixed anyway)

Just not sure which one is the best one if this is even a good idea to begin with.

Any ideas on which of the above would be best to focus on? I only have less than $100 in each (late to the crypto bandwagon and not that much money to my name at the moment) but I’m hoping it’s not too late to see gains after a bit more sizable investment in one of them plus consistent DCA.

2025-06-13,Are exchange tokens a better options for profit when compared to other ALTs?,"I came across a post made by CryptoRank comparing what would have happened if you held $10,000 in major exchange tokens for 1 month, and thee were a few interesting things I noticed. 

https://preview.redd.it/q3hj6ear6s6f1.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca650782af575db2185e12ccc15ca145cbeba417

It doesn't come as a surprise that BNB led in overall return, I think the surprise for me is the fact that BGB had the highest farming rewards, which made up over 60% of its total profit, so that's something to look at especially for people looking for more profit options. 

 Moving on from these two, I noticed that OKB gave no farming rewards but the total profit made isn't that bad, but MNT and GT underperformed both in price and total value. Surprisingly though MNT offered the second highest farming reward, but that wasn’t even enough to offset the price drop.

I think generally it has a lot to with stuffs happening with these exchanges behind the scenes, and it's probably why BNB and even BGB did very well, especially with the impressive price action with BGB in recent time. But all this to say, exchange tokens might also be a good option for profits especially when selected carefully.

2025-06-15,Some 'Alternative' info and thoughts about 'Alt'coins,"1. If BTC could absorb the marketcap of ALL the coins except for the top 10, it would increase... only 20%.  The idea that altcoins hurt BTC is likely false.  Competition is healthy- it means there is demand.  So we can relax, altcoins aren't ruining your investment.

2. There are not 17M + ""alt"" coins.  Those are mostly memecoins or very specific use case driven projects leveraging blockchain concepts.  

3. As noted in the first bullet, 80% of the value is still in the top 10.  After about the top 1000, the value isn't worth talking about.  

  
4. If we have decided BTC is the store of value, then it's fair to say many of the top 100 are more prepared to serve as a payment system, or deliver a business specific use case.  This means they aren't an alternative to BTC, and they aren't competing for the same marketshare.    
  
5. Smart contracts are an ""alternative"" concept- the added value to blockchain continues to evolve.  If this proves to be valuable enough within a store of value use case, then perhaps that is an ""altcoin"" directly competing with BTC.

6. ""Altseason"" 4 years ago mostly applied to ethereum and new coins.  Now we have a wide variety of alts in the top 1000, all in different stages earning marketshare.  Many top coins have higher marketcaps, so achieving 10x or more from those levels does seem challenging.  New coins face competition, and much greater scrutiny, so the percentage that breakout will not match the last cycle.

7. Higher Marketcaps? This doesn't mean they are sitting near all time highs - some are though!  It means many are sitting at higher lows than 4 years ago.  Btw, if you are achieving higher lows, that does not mean you are disappearing, that means you are growing.  A common talking point is these projects are disappearing, which simply is not true. 

8. Calling any alt a ""shitcoin"" is a pathetic attack which ignores the potential value of using the technology.  Just a reminder, they are building upon the same concepts BTC leverages.  More folks believing in blockchain tech strengthens the space, including BTC.  It would be good to see open discussion again about what is being achieved with the mindset that not everything is a threat to your investment.

In summary- while the narratives attack altcoins, they really aren't hurting BTC investments.  There is a variety of market opportunity that BTC is not suited for.  Investing in altcoins is more challenging than 4 years ago- choosing from old and new, big and small.  But it is healthy and positive for the space overall if investment continues.  ",0.977

2025-06-16,Bitcoin Buying Timing: War Fears and Market Recovery Analysis,"The market has been rattled once more by rising tensions between Iran and Israel. This news was enough to shake the entire asset market, including cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin briefly threatening the $100,000 mark and altcoins facing steep corrections. It’s a familiar scene—one of recurring fear and doubt. But what does it all truly mean?

Looking back, similar conflicts unfolded in April and October 2024. The market reacted with momentary panic and a surge in selling, only to recover swiftly within days. This time appears no different. **The fact that fear hasn’t lingered long suggests this is less a structural collapse and more a technical reaction.** It’s a clue that there’s more to this than just a price drop—something worth examining beneath the surface.

The Iran-Israel conflict has been limited to strategic airstrikes and restrained missile responses, without direct ground confrontation. This points to a localized skirmish rather than an all-out war, likely acting as an event that pauses the market’s existing rhythm rather than redefining its course. In other words, this uncertainty may fade within days rather than persist.

[Bitcoin Market Analysis: Liquidation Zones and Price Trends on June 15, 2025, by The Kingfisher.](https://preview.redd.it/utrj5gmh397f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b419271bb70e2dfca7d6d4aaf326af078761c909)

  
**This hints that, between collapse and counterattack, the latter is gaining traction**. Meanwhile, Ethereum is showing striking momentum, with trading volume and futures open interest hitting all-time highs, suggesting not just a technical bounce but a structural signal of institutional entry.

https://preview.redd.it/2tuvu7pk397f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=79607c04fc202d58fb737a40519c06c54963873a

  
The ETH/BTC ratio further confirms Ethereum’s relative strength, **shifting focus from short-term price swings to the potential for a broader transition.**

The altcoin market tells a bigger story. The OTHERS market cap chart shows it breaking out of a months-long downtrend, now digesting consolidation in the Phase D zone. If this level holds, a return to an upward cycle seems plausible.

[A Chart Depicting Others Market Capitalization](https://preview.redd.it/9pawsexm397f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a154354aa5a8dd2ef33bdc735a64d753f37c8af6)



**This isn’t a mere bearish turn but a retest of the upper boundary of the prior downtrend channel—a technical validation of support.**

[A Chart Depicting TOTAL3](https://preview.redd.it/24faw2zp397f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d2f55a4b8ae38f90b80b590c4e9324fba1b8ebc)

  
The TOTAL3 index reinforces this, with the altcoin market’s cycle of surge, correction, support confirmation, and rebreakout still intact, currently poised for its next expansion.

Amid this, Coinbase’s inclusion in the S&P 500 marks a symbolic shift. It’s not just a stock update—it’s a structural milestone for the cryptocurrency industry crossing into mainstream acceptance. Wall Street no longer sees digital assets as outliers but as candidates for integration. The door to institutionalization is opening.

Ripple, meanwhile, has been quietly consolidating in a box range for 195 days. This prolonged stagnation could precede an explosive breakout in either direction, with the 2.08 level acting as a key support that, if held, might serve as a buying point.

Ultimately, the market is swaying in uncertainty, but that uncertainty could fuel the next move. The pattern of war, fear, correction, and rebound has repeated through 2024 and now into June 2025. History suggests these dips often recover quickly, laying the groundwork for fresh rallies. Rather than being paralyzed by fear, it might be worth reading the structure of the flow and preparing for what’s next. Opportunities don’t come often, but when they do, they’re brief and potent.

2025-06-16,"Right now, BTC is caught between FOMO and fear. The market is bullish — but the world isn’t exactly stable.","On one hand, we’ve got solid bullish signals:  
• SharpLink Gaming just bought $463 million worth of ETH, becoming the largest public ETH holder.  
• Anthony Pompliano is reportedly raising $750 million via a SPAC to buy Bitcoin. Yes, *that* Pompliano — the one who was calling for $500K BTC during the bear market.  
• BTC hit $110,000 last Tuesday — almost breaking its ATH of $111,940 from May 22.

— On the other hand, the macro picture isn't so pretty:  
• Israeli airstrikes on Iran sent BTC down 2.8% in 90 minutes. They can crash BTC at any moment, all it takes is another hit.  
• Last time, $427 million in long positions got wiped out. Bulls took a hit, fast.

# So, can BTC still reach $119,000 in this climate?

Personally, I’m cautiously optimistic.

✓ The fundamentals are strong: institutional adoption, post-halving supply tightening, growing ETF demand, and now SPACs targeting BTC.  
✗ But short-term moves are still dictated by geopolitics. And that’s not something even the whales can control.

So yes, $119K is possible — but timing it depends more on global stability than TA.

# What about Ethereum?

ETH is quietly building up momentum too:  
• SharpLink staked over 95% of its ETH — that’s a long-term move, not just speculation.  
• If this continues, a return to $4,000 feels realistic. Not immediate, but definitely in sight — especially if the SEC eases up.

What do you think?  
• Can BTC still hit $119K this year?  
• Are we underestimating the impact of war and instability?  
• Should ETH be getting more attention right now?

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the fifth monthly report for the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 JUNE Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7.5 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** ***on the blog.***
* **MAY Highlights:** Another mostly green month; **ETH** has its best month of 2025. **BTC** in overall lead with **Tron** in second place, also the only two cryptos in the 2025 Experiment aren't underwater YTD (anyone predict this?).
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 8 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+265% vs S&P500's +63% - see below for details).

# Month Five – Down -13%

https://preview.redd.it/vi919nm1be7f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=411a7d22897f681d981dd8e3057e9d8cba0110e4

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

May highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Similar to April, lots of green
* **ETH** pops
* Only two cryptos are in positive territory YTD: **BTC** and **Tron** (how many guessed this correctly on January 1st?).

# May Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

Five months into 2025, not much movement: only **AVAX** has dropped out of the Top Ten.  

# May Winners and Losers

https://preview.redd.it/0b44goq2be7f1.png?width=266&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa633625fb535258a03587d76002eccc467245da

  
Five months into 2025, not much movement: only **AVAX** has dropped out of the Top Ten.  

# May Winners and Losers

***May Winners*** – For the first time in a long time, **ETH** (+36%) has a very good month. **BTC**, **Tron**, and **BNB** were each up about 10% as well.

***May Losers*** – **AVAX** lost ground compared to its peers this month, down -6% in May. 

# Overall Update: BTC maintains the lead, portfolio under water, most cryptos in negative territory, AVAX in last

Year to date **BTC** (+12%) maintains the lead with **Tron** (+5%) in second.  The rest are either flat or in the red and **AVAX** is the worst performer (-42%) YTD.

After a fairly good start (the portfolio was +7% in January), the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio is down -13%.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BTC** five months ago is worth $112 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio gained $45 in May, about the same it gained in April. The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$867**, still underwater for 2025, but moving in the right direction.

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

https://preview.redd.it/ukmb7wy9be7f1.png?width=180&format=png&auto=webp&s=2378ad218a938950a521a7bd08e6935eacaca4c0

2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last 7.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens like I do for my Experiments).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, five months later: 

https://preview.redd.it/y7q54mecbe7f1.png?width=203&format=png&auto=webp&s=347bd9719d9e696db0aea11855a62cef24ec8686

  
**May Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: +5% 
* **COIN50**: +12%

The May monthly victory goes to: **COIN50** (its second monthly victory)

**Overall since January 1st, 2025:** 

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -13%
* **COIN50**: -10%

Overall lead:  **COIN50**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +50% (total value $1,500)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +671% (total value $7,705)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +890% (total value $9,898) (***best performing portfolio***\*)\*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +315% (total value $4,153)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -15% (total value $851) (***worst performing portfolio***\*)\*
* 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +168% (total value $2,676)
* 2024 Top Ten Experiment: up +54% (total value $1,535)
* 2025 Top Ten Experiment: down -13% (total value $867)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$29,186.**

https://preview.redd.it/jpk8ssihbe7f1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a9c3f4b134922f56f6212df2aacd5fcad6cbd3e

**That’s up +265%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was **November 2021’s all time high** of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/8mk8ua2kbe7f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5c21d4e9337ac43d8224939b8490960486cfa55

In summary: ***That’s a +265% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is down -5% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $953 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,212 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,359 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,830 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,574 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,240 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,540 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,239 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,005 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,000.**

That is up **+63%** since January 2018 compared to a **+265%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  May’s extended report is on the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio.  For more data, you can check out the latest 2018-2024 Top Ten reports as well.",0.9994

2025-06-17,The market is bleeding — but the real crash might be on ETH…,"# Everything's red. BTC is correcting hard, alts are getting slapped with -15% like it’s tradition, and everyone’s looking for a scapegoat: Iran, Israel, the Fed, whales... the usual.

But honestly, **what hits me the most is Ethereum.**

# ETH/BTC has been dumping for 1,190 days straight

Not weeks. **Days.**  
Almost 3 and a half years of bleeding, and now we’ve just **lost a major support at 0.027 ₿**.  
Next stop? Could be 0.017 ₿. And in the worst-case scenario? People are talking about 0.009 ₿. That would take us back to levels not seen since 2017.

In other words: **ETH hasn’t been this weak vs BTC since 2020.**

# And yet… something feels off 🤔

At this point, I’d expect panic. Rage selling. “ETH is dead” posts all over the place.

But that’s not what I’m seeing.  
There’s this weird calm — even **a silent uptick in activity**.

Take ETH loan protocols for example — **Bitget Crypto Loan, similar to Spark,** if you prefer DeFi. Their usage is climbing. And it’s ETH being borrowed.  
So even though price is dumping, **it looks like some people are injecting liquidity into ETH, quietly stacking through loans.**

# So now I’m wondering…

Is this a **giant bear trap** in disguise?  
Or is it just CEX platforms holding up the illusion of demand?  
Or… maybe ETH really is just irrelevant now, and I’m the one in denial? 😅

# Honestly, I don’t have the answer. But here’s how it feels to me:

* **ETH is underperforming. Badly.**
* The ETH/BTC ratio is tanking hard.
* But **it looks like whales are quietly accumulating**, using lending platforms that are simpler than classic DeFi.
* And maybe — just maybe — **we’re near a historical bottom**. One of those “make or break” moments.

So what are you doing with your ETH right now?  
Swapping to BTC? Lending it out? Just holding and hoping for a reversal? Or you just don’t care anymore?

Really curious to hear how others are feeling. Even if you’re a full-on BTC maxi, drop your take.",0.6932

**tldr: I'm Jung, cofounder of Lantern Finance (**[**www.lantern.finance**](http://www.lantern.finance)**), a US-based crypto lending platform built in response to the 2022 collapse of lenders like BlockFi and Celsius. Unlike them, we never rehypothecate collateral and store all assets in insured cold storage with BitGo.** 

**We support loans straight to your bank account against BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, LTC, DOGE, and more. Our mission is to offer the safest, most transparent crypto-backed loans. AMA and would love any feedback!**

Hey r/CryptoCurrency! 

My name is Jung, and I’m one of the founders of Lantern Finance, a US-based crypto-backed lending platform. I got started into crypto in 2016 and fell deep in the rabbit hole, having played around with several projects and platforms. In particular, I became a huge fan of BlockFi when I found out about them in 2019. The ability to borrow dollars against my crypto without selling and triggering capital gains taxes in a convenient custodial way, appealed to me.

However, fast forward to 2022, we all know what happened. The entire space imploded as we found out that crypto lenders like BlockFi, Celsius, and Voyager were rehypothecating (lending out) client collateral on an unsecured basis. They were basically double dipping - making money on the loans we took out as well as the crypto collateral we posted. I, along with millions of others, lost a decent chunk of our hard-earned crypto. 

That experience inspired my cofounders and me to build Lantern Finance ([www.lantern.finance](http://www.lantern.finance)). Lantern is a US based crypto backed lending platform that prioritizes safety of client funds over profit. Here is how we do things differently: 

* We hold borrower collateral in cold storage with BitGo, a US based qualified custodian, with insurance up to $250MM. 
* We NEVER lend out borrower collateral - they just sit in insured cold storage. 
* We lend against a broad group of blue-chip assets like: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, LTC, and DOGE. If there’s an asset you want to borrow against that we don’t support, let me know! 
* Our goal is to offer the most secure, convenient, and seamless crypto-backed lending experience for everyone.

My experience spans traditional finance, the (relatively) early crypto days, the crypto implosion of 2022, and now building Lantern, a fast growing crypto startup.

2025-06-20,apparent fraudulent exchange pyth-usvpu  taken offline following abuse reports filed with the registrar Gname,"pyth-usvpu . top

This site was not a basic phishing attempt but a fully operational fraudulent exchange: it featured what appeared to be live trading interfaces, market-synchronized data, wallet connections, and credible deposit functionality. Funds could be transferred in from legitimate platforms such as Coinbase, and balances were reflected accurately—at least at first.

The deception became evident only when attempting to withdraw. At that point, the platform presented users with an unexpected “tax” demand: approximately 15% of profits, supposedly to satisfy U.S. regulatory requirements. This payment was framed as unlocking the withdrawal process; however, it appears more accurately described as an apparent ransom—a final-stage extraction under the pretense of compliance.

This scam bears resemblance to what was portrayed in the film The Sting: not just a fake email or login screen, but an elaborate infrastructure intended to simulate a fully legitimate exchange. Every element—from trading graphs to live chats—was built to reinforce user trust and conceal the fraud until the moment of financial capture.

The site used the name and design language of the Pyth Network, a well-known decentralized finance data oracle. This impersonation poses risks beyond personal loss; it could cause reputational harm to the broader DeFi ecosystem, to the Pyth brand, and even to Singapore’s financial credibility, as the scammers represented themselves as tied to an investment firm based in Singapore. Victims may mistakenly associate the fraud with Singaporean banking practices, especially if they were told—as one was—that a relative in Singapore had a team of 35 professionals using the platform.

This case also mirrors elements of an FBI-documented scam involving:

A WhatsApp-based grooming process,

A scammer using the surname “Li,”

An exchange front that collapsed after a ransom-like tax demand.

That investigation, led by FBI Special Agent Bret Curtis (San Diego Field Office), is publicly available here: [https://ia800108.us.archive.org/25/items/gov.uscourts.utd.153597/gov.uscourts.utd.153597.1.1.pdf#page=3.17](https://ia800108.us.archive.org/25/items/gov.uscourts.utd.153597/gov.uscourts.utd.153597.1.1.pdf#page=3.17)

The fraudulent exchange, hosted at web.pyth-usvpu . top, has now been taken offline following abuse reports filed with the registrar. Relevant authorities have been notified; a complaint has also been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and to the FBI.

If you interacted with this site or were targeted through similar methods, consider submitting a report to  and contacting your regional cybercrime unit. This is likely part of a larger international fraud network, and your report could support broader investigation and takedown efforts.

2025-06-20,Do you think Crytocurrency will be like Tulips were in the Netherlands and completely go away?,"The Tulip Craze, also known as ""Tulipomania,"" was a period of intense speculation and inflation in the Netherlands during the 17th century, specifically between 1634 and 1637. 

During this time, tulip bulbs became a highly sought-after commodity, with prices reaching exorbitant levels. 

The phenomenon was characterized by an unprecedented level of enthusiasm and frenzy among the Dutch population, particularly in the country's wealthy merchant class.

To understand the Tulip Craze, it's essential to consider the economic and cultural context of the Netherlands during the 17th century. 

The country was experiencing a period of rapid economic growth, driven by its emergence as a major trading power. 

The Dutch East India Company had established a monopoly on the spice trade, and the Netherlands had become a hub for international commerce. 

As a result, the country's wealthy merchant class had accumulated significant wealth and were looking for new investment opportunities.  

Tulips, which had been introduced to Europe from Turkey  in the 

mid th century, became a popular luxury item among the Dutch elite. 

The flowers were prized for their vibrant colors and unique shapes, 

and they quickly became a status symbol. As the demand for tulips  grew, so did their prices. 

Initially, the high prices were driven by the rarity and beauty of the flowers. However, as the speculation intensified, prices began to rise exponentially, far exceeding the value of the flowers themselves.The tulip trade became a speculative bubble, with people buying and selling tulip bulbs without ever seeing the flowers. The bulbs were traded on the stock exchanges, and contracts were signed for the delivery of specific bulbs at specific prices. The rarest bulbs, such as the Semper Augustus and the Viceroy, became highly sought after, and their prices skyrocketed.  

According to some accounts, a single bulb of the Semper Augustus variety sold for an astonishing 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman.

The speculation was fueled by the ease of trading tulip bulbs. Unlike other commodities, tulips were easy to store and transport, and their value could be easily verified. The bulbs were also seen as a safe

 investment, as they could be stored for long periods without spoiling. 

As a result, people from all walks of life, including merchants, artisans, and even ordinary citizens, became involved in the tulip trade.

The Tulip Craze reached its peak in the winter of 1636-1637. 

Prices were rising rapidly, and people were buying bulbs solely for the purpose of selling them at a higher price. The market became detached from reality, with prices determined by speculation rather than the actual value of the bulbs. It was not uncommon for people to trade their life savings for a single bulb, hoping to make a fortune by selling it at a higher price.",0.9929

2025-06-20,Diversification,"I saw a meme of a guy with a solar panel on his head charging his phone and it said something about crypto guys when people say what if theres no electricity.

I mean if world got nuked and everything went to shit then yeah crypto is worthless, thats pretty obvious. So I'm wondering how many people here have invested into anything else like precious metals or even jewels. I view precious metals as a hedge against inflation but I don't expect it to ever skyrocket unless the silver price manipulation ends and that would take some tremendous events. That said if I want something that's likely to go up 5x, 10x or 50x in the coming decades I'm looking at crypto or maybe certain stocks. Why would people want all their eggs in one basket with either? Are there some people here who have the vast majority of their investments in either crypto/stocks and have a very small amount of precious metals?

I'm not looking to debate which is better or what circumstances would they thrive, just curious how many people diversified there investment no matter what the ratio may be. At this point I have maybe $1500 more invested into crypto then silver and I started with silver in August 2024 and crypto in December. Yeah not the best times to get into either of them but it got me involved with them so I cant complain

A breakdown of how several well-known billionaires went from mocking Bitcoin to actively investing in it. If you’ve been around long enough, you’ve probably noticed this pattern:

1. **Kevin O’Leary** — in 2019 called Bitcoin “garbage” and useless for payments. By 2021, he had 3–5% of his portfolio in BTC and now claims crypto is 20% of his net worth.
2. **Ray Dalio** — described Bitcoin as a bubble in 2017. In 2021, he admitted he owns some and sees it as “digital gold.”
3. **Mark Cuban** — said in 2019 he’d rather have bananas than Bitcoin. A few years later, he started investing heavily in DeFi and NFTs.
4. **John McAfee** — early critic of Bitcoin, then became one of its loudest promoters with extreme price predictions.
5. **Jamie Dimon** — famously called Bitcoin a fraud in 2017. While still personally skeptical, JPMorgan now offers BTC access to clients.

Although, I don't know too much about it, I still keep up with the main stable coins (BTC, ETH, SOL) and am pretty decently invested about 5% of my portfolio to crypto. 

My main question is would a crypto debit/credit card be worth it for me? I am intrigued by the cash back aspect of spending USD/USDC and then receiving cash back for it. However, there were a few things that concerned me:

1. Taxes - I live in the USA. I read somewhere that every transaction used on these cards is basically treated as a profit/loss and you must report this on taxes. Is this truly a pain and is the headache worth using this card still?
2. Benefits - How much would this really benefit me? My main reasoning for getting one is to make DCA'ing easier for me. Instead of DCA'ing going forward, I would be receiving 1-2% back with crypto.com's visa card and would almost exclusively use this card over my debit card.

Sorry, I am still new to this and trying to grasp if this would be a good idea for me. Don't go too hard in the comments, thank you.

There are no more pigs left to slaughter since everyone became aware that crypto as a whole is a scam.

The belief system that made this industry work has completely collapsed.

At least in 2017 people actually believed in those crazy ICOs or whenever a new chain would come out.

There was genuine excitement, real conviction behind every project.

Nowadays it's like: ""Oh a new chain? Wow another VC backed scam to dump on retail.""

The shift happened fast and it's permanent.

Nobody believes in anything anymore, I respect the SPX6900 community for trying to change that but sadly they have failed.

Crypto topped in 2021. Everyone I know peaked their NW then and since then it has been down only with no exceptions.

Most of you just aren't willing to admit to it, respect to gainzy for actually doing so.

Look at Su Zhu, he peaked at billions in 2021 but could barely make $40m this cycle.

People think pump fun is extractive but they have only managed to extract $700m this cycle.

Those are rookie numbers if you compare it to OpenSea in 2021 who extracted BILLIONS.

We have gone from a gold rush to fighting over scraps, the only winners were VCs and exchange founders.

Crypto can be compared to the Japanese stock market in the 1980s. Yes there's an ever expanding money supply globally, but it doesn't necessarily have to trickle down to crypto.

When there is an aging population, like there is now in crypto, that doesn't result in more buyers.

In fact, anyone who would have bought into crypto already has and lost all their money.

There are simply no new buyers and it makes sense, who keeps returning to the same casino that makes them lose every single time?

You need a few big wins occasionally to keep going, but what we have now are just people consistently losing.

Bitcoin is the only exception and will survive since alts/BTC is perma down only and won't reverse anytime soon. Even Vitalik knows Ethereum is cooked.

I guess everyone knew that BTC maxis were right but our thesis was that we could gamble and outperform BTC with alts.

We were wrong.

Crypto is dead as an industry, pack it up if you're trying to make money here. Extract whatever you can and leave.

I agree with what he said for the most part. Bitcoin breaking 100k didn’t give us the Altcoin season we were expecting.. I believe there is still life in this space.. but man it’s damn hard to make it in crypto now.. use to be $100 and a dream, now it seems like you need way more capital to make it big in this space. Unless you’re god tier lucky, catching plays early and hodling out for big gains..

I’m personally taking a break from the space, need to pay down debt and losing money like I have been when I could be paying down debt doesn’t feel good.. hopefully when I’m back in a couple months markets are looking really good and alts are getting love again.

So, if 19 million bitcoin are presently “minted” and only 4% of the population are holders….

At max there’ll be 21 million minted equating to approximately 5% of the population. What good is a “currency” that only 5% of the population owns??? Are we going to use it just between each other while 98.2% of the population uses something else???

The Ethereum network just reached a new all time high in transaction count of 24.45 million processed over a single week. That is more than 145,000 transactions per hour or over 2,400 every minute.

As you can see in the chart above, this is not just a coincidence, you can clearly see that it keeps growing and growing in the long term. It is a clear signal of how far the Ethereum ecosystem has come and the amazing path it has ahead.

Ethereum ecosystem keeps growing and evolving showing that the upgrades made are working as expected and ready to keep growing and evolving.

This growth reflects increasing user engagement, more wallets, more dApps, more protocols launching and more real utility being built. Ethereum ecosystem is the go to ecosystem and this is just the beginning of a new era.

Ethereum is not longer a promise of the future, it is becoming the foundational layer of the decentralized internet right now.

Numbers don't lie, Ethereum is scaling, adapting and thriving.

Ethereum is the future and we are witnessing its rise.

Then, they got in some outside consultants and it went to shit, got 'hacked', consigned to the rubbish dump histories.  So sad.

Glad to still be in this space, but have to say since 2017 this part of the world is still not crypto savvy I got no one here I talk crypto too, no btc atms about, no crypto savvy banks(Westpac was for a while then nada) no shops with bitcoin accepted here signs.

2025-06-27,Update: received my money back from Celsius after 2-3years,"Hello,

Europoor here, 

I posted a month ago to know if there refund from the bankruptcy that Celsius was fake or not because it asked many details like passport and phone number.

And also it used Hyperwallet from PayPal which sounded dodgy as fuck. 

But i did ll the studf even though i coudnt find much info online about this and checked that it was celsius.hyperwallet in the main adress.

Anyway, they finally gave me 600 pounds that I had to have a locked diamond hand as they got bankrupt and I couldn't get my money back.

Funny thing is that as BTC increased in value I also got more money out than in  (would have been better off  not playing with bankrupt Celsius though).

So yes it was a long process but I got money back, and as I have not seen anyone else talk about it here I  wanted to inform you that it worked. ",0.8834
2025-06-27,Is XRP Showing Signs of a Reversal?,"I have been tracking XRP for some time now, and I have to admit, I've been torn about how to handle this. The XRP/BTC pair has been so underperforming for such a long time, dropping to levels we haven't seen in quite some time. It left me wondering whether XRP has simply lost its place in the market, or if something is quietly developing beneath the surface.  
  
I still come across posts and videos talking about how XRP/BTC is forming a falling wedge chart pattern. My interpretation of a falling wedge is that it's a setup that can potentially turn for the better if price breaks out to the upside. Yet, simultaneously, the trend has been down for so long that it's hard not to be bearish. Technical patterns don't always pan out, especially in crypto where news, sentiment, and regulatory issues can completely overwhelm chart setups.

Another factor in mind is that while XRP may have these banking and financial institution collaborations, it does not necessarily mean healthy market performance, at least not against Bitcoin. BTC remains strong, with other coins such as XRP failing to keep up. I wonder if [XRP/BTC](https://www.bitget.com/spot/XRPBTC) can realistically stay in compliance again, or if traders and investors have largely moved to other projects with more hype or more concrete use cases.

One of the variables that continue to muddy the waters is the SEC vs. Ripple court fight. While technically that is specifically regarding XRP, I believe it has a lot of influence on XRP/BTC too, because regulatory uncertainty has traders nervous holding XRP versus holding Bitcoin. Until that gets settled, I don't know how much confidence the market is going to have, no matter what the charts are indicating

Therefore, my questions are:

1. Has anyone else been following the XRP/BTC pair very closely? Is the descending wedge something you are taking seriously, or just noise in a long downtrend?

1. Is there any underlying reason why XRP would do better than BTC, other than technical signals?

1. Do you think the traders will shift back into XRP once the legal issues are gone, or has XRP lost the momentum forever against BTC?

Not investment advice, simply seeking some diverse perspectives and attempting to decipher what might be on the horizon for XRP/BTC.",-0.8724

The NIGHT token is used to generate DUST, a shielded network resource that powers transactions, promoting sustainable operations and enabling free transactions for holders who generate enough DUST. The process consists of three Claim phases and a Redemption period, where eligible participants can claim token allocations without purchase. The token supply will be allocated as follows:

**Claim Phase 1: Glacier Drop**

* 50% to ADA holders
* 20% to BTC holders
* 30% split among holders of ETH, SOL, XRP, BNB, AVAX, and BAT, in proportion to their relative USD value

**Claim Phase 2: Scavenger Mine**

100% of unclaimed tokens from the Glacier Drop phase will be:

* Distributed among participants
* Allocated to core network constituents (Midnight Foundation, Midnight TGE, Reserve, and on-chain Treasury)
* Carried over to the next claim phase (Lost-and-Found)

**Claim Phase 3: Lost-and-Found**

In the Lost-and-Found phase, eligible individuals who missed the Glacier Drop claim phase can claim a fraction of their original token entitlements from the remaining tokens in the Lost-and-Found pool.

How does one just ""issue"" a coin. I get that you want a coin that is pegged to the dollar. But doesn't this defeat the purpose of wanting your assets tied to a currency that depreciates due to inflation (the dollar)? 

I've heard when you buy crypto, you first buy a stable coin first. Maybe I don't see this buying through a broker like robinhood or coinbase, but when i buy BTC, I use cash dollars in my robinhood and/or coinbase account. What am I not getting here. Why tf would I want a stable coin?",0.9467
2025-06-27,Fidelity Crypto allowing coin transfers to/from accounts!,"Fidelity rolling out coin transfers to/from wallets!

I’m pretty excited about this. Fidelity is another entire world compared to Coinbase. Myself and buddies were having issues wiring large amounts to Coinbase and couldn’t even get someone on the phone. Fidelity has 24/7 customer service to help with whatever.

It’s in its infancy but they’re rolling out the withdrawal capabilities to some people gradually and should be done in the next few months. Digital assets team said they would expect my request for it. For now you can only transfer $25k worth of coins to a wallet per day. 1% spread for buy/sell
Of course anyone can just buy the ETF, in any brokerage account, with no spread but if we want BTC to fully succeed people are going to need to be able to pay for things with it. 
Half the population of the US either has a Fidelity account or has a family member that has a Fidelity account so this is a big deal. The people in the subreddit probably have no problem with technology, but the vast majority of wealthy people would feel uncomfortable transferring several million dollars into their coinbase account, a company that doesn’t even have human customer service. The chat was okay but not enough to give me or my buddy peace of mind. He wired in $1MM and they froze his account despite being a long time acct holder. A week later it’s still frozen. They rejected my wire and made me jump through a bunch of hoops to end up saying I had to let several days pass before trying again.
Anyway my intention was to share the good news about Fidelity.

A few that come to mind:
– Companies holding huge amounts of BTC - what happens if they’re forced to liquidate?
– Stablecoins that are systemically important but not fully transparent.
– Layer 2s or DeFi protocols with vulnerabilities that haven’t been stress-tested at scale.
– Overconcentration of liquidity or volume on a few centralised platforms.

2025-06-28,Restaking on Solana just got a bit more interesting (and flexible),"Anyone of you guys into staking? Possibilities and available platforms are many but I just noticed some kind of different brewing on Solana and it was Fragmetric. It’s not your usual staking protocol. You can restake $SOL, $JTO, $BTC, even stablecoins, and still keep those assets liquid for DeFi moves. It’s not locking you out of the rest of the ecosystem.

The setup feels thoughtful too. It runs on Jito’s VRTs (vault receipt tokens), and gives you $fragSOL when you deposit. That $fragSOL can be used across DeFi, while still earning staking + MEV + extra network rewards (they’re calling it NCN/AVS). 

What actually stood out though is their point system F Points. It calculates based on how much and how long you stake (tokens × seconds × 0.001). You rack these up for future rewards and airdrops. Bonus if you’re using Backpack wallet  gets a 1.3x boost.

Feels like they’re laying groundwork for something modular rather than just another restaking farm.

Honestly, if Fragmetric starts letting me restake my bad decisions too, I might finally break even in this market lol.

2025-07-02,Did you own any Raiblocks/Nano in 2017 - what made you buy it? and what made you sell?,"Did you own any Raiblocks/Nano in 2017 - what made you buy it? 

I remember I first got interested in crypto in 2017, because i had seen bitcoin go up in price earlier and a lot of friends were talking about it, so I also wanted to try to earn money by buying bitcoin. 

Regitering on exchanges were really difficult, when i started since there was so many people trying to sign up that it took multiple weeks for KYC to finish. I then registered on localbitcoin and bought via them. I remember transfering my first bitcoin out of localbitcoin was a really scary experience as i had to make sure i pasted the correct btc adresse, i remember it was really expensive to transfer bitcoin then, i spent around $50 in fees to transfer to my wallet and it took around and hour until i saw the transaction had been recived. 

After having has some experience sending bitcoin around, i did more research about the technology and its purpose. The more i learned about bitcoin and its idea the more i become interested in decentralized digital cash. I liked the idea of having a currency that was not controlled by a central government that basically controls society with their ability to print money and bail themselves out whenever they fuck up.

This is when I started looking into other cryptocurrencies, like Stellar, Vechain, XRP and Raiblocks. First i looked at XRP and apparently it was very fast and cheap to send, but I did not like coin distribution and many said it was centralized, it basically seemed like banking 2.0.

In the the crypto I liked the most was Nano due to multiple factors and the biggest one was probably the initial distribution. 5% of supply was allocated to the dev fund while the rest was given away via google captchas, this way everyone with internet access could participate in the distribution, no need for expensive mining equipment. The idea of having a fully distributed supply was something i found really compelling, similar to how people in bitcoin is exited for yeah 2140 when bitcoin is fully distributed, but with Nano the supply was already fully distributed and there was no need to wait. 

I found Nano really unqiue in the crypo space since it was the only crypto that had fully distributed supply and was feeless. The Nano devs believed they were able to secure the network without rewarding node operators, the idea was to create a network as efficient as possible to make the cost of running a node an insignificant expense. With Nodes being so cheap to run it allows for more decentralization since most people can afford to run one.

I also liked the idea that everyone that owned some Nano, no matter how little is able to participate in the consensus by choosing their own representative. This way if 10 million people own 1 Nano each, they will be strong together if they all delegate their voting weight to the same node. The total supply is 133 million, so those 10 million people would have 7.7% of the voting weight to delegate to whoever they want.

What i really liked about Nano was its simplicity, its supposed to be a pure currency, nothing more, and i think this is its biggest strengths.

I still sell some Nano here and there, mostly when buy services.

2025-07-03,Alt seasons may be dead. So go for big coin leverage plays..,"Alt coins and alt seasons seem to be no more. 

The 'its all about the tech' was always bullshit but now noones even pretending.

Theres pumps all over the place but removing memes, the value related token are so few now.

It seems its small pumps and then drip drip

So where is the market going?

Unsuprisingly at least to me, crypto is now full mainstream. And the mainstream big finance companies are piling in.

But they arent going for some random coin.

Theyre going for btc etfs.. which we all know but instead of an etf there are companies holding crypto e.g. microstrategy...many listed companies are now building their own treasury reserves following in micostrategys foot steps.mstr is not an etf. They use leverage to buy btc. So you get bigger pumps and bigger dumps.

So whats the play?

Well you could buy shares in mstr. 

But if youre hoping for greater gains the area taking of is eth treasuries.

Maybe youre thinking eth is dead.. but thats the perfext time to build a position. Eth is not going anywhere. Recent upgrade made it deflationary and theres huge hype in finance around stable coins all of the main ones being on eth.

So while ive kept my no hope alt coins uve also started a position in SBET. A US listed company


Theyve started with buying about $500m of eth. They also appoint joe lubin as their chairman. This isnt an etf. So more risk more reward. Especially if they use leverage like mstr.

Another companyq hich went nuts this week was BMNR. Massive hype as a fund owner tom lee has appointed chairman and was on msnbc. This is way iverhyped and valued right now.. might be worth looking at in a couple of weeks

Anyway.. im following the trend. Sitting on a discord with other believers has achived nothing. 

Publicly listed companies exposed to big coiners seems like the way to go.

Hi all,

Within the last day eight separate transactions, each for almost exactly 10 000 BTC, have landed on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the pattern looks far from finished.What I’m seeing so far

\- Every transaction sweeps dozens of very old P2PKH inputs (some dating back to 2016) into one fresh Bech32 (SegWit v0) output, paying only \~0.00035 BTC in fees.

\- The new 10 000 BTC outputs are still unspent (no follow-up hops yet).

\- All eight transactions draw their first inputs from the same 2016 transaction, just different output indices, strongly suggesting a single owner.

\- The running total now sits at 80 000 BTC (≈ $8 billion at current prices) parked in eight brand-new addresses—and more transactions could arrive.

Is this a normal behaviour? It's likely not over as the last transaction is 15 minutes old",0.5267

I've seen people praise Strike, but unfortunately it didn't work like I hoped with a card and the bank transfers turned out to be too pricey for me. I have had a look at Kraken which allows for easy recurring purchases from a card, but that comes with its fees I presume. 

The cheapest option would be spot trading I guess, but then I would have to either purchase manually or set up a bot which I have never done before. Therefore I am curious to hear what people here do to DCA.

2025-07-04,Did I make a mistake while transferring BTC to my cold wallet?,"Noob here.

Last week I transfered some fiat and converted it into BTC. I then made the smallest transaction possible (0,0008 BTC, with a 0,0004 BTC fee) toward my cold wallet (Tangem) and it went through perfectly. I then transferred the rest of my BTC toward my cold wallet, but a few hours later the transaction failed.
Here is where it gets weird :
- I received a few emails mentioning I will get an answer within 3 to 5 business days (so sometime during this past week), but I still haven’t receive anything back
- the c.com support tells me that it will be transferred back into my bank account (which doesn’t accept BTC obviously, and they don’t even have my bank info)
- there is an “adjustment (transfer)” that seems to be pending, no further details available, but it is approximately 0,001 BTC (100€) less than the initial transfer. Support tells me that it might be due to price fluctuations (but to transfer 0,1 BTC from the exchange to a cold wallet is still 0,1 BTC - fees right?)
- support tells me not to worry (they are right, we are just talking about my life savings here) and that it should be resolved “soon” (no further details available, it could be hours or months, nobody knows)
- when I asked “why was it cancelled” they told me “because it didn’t went through” (no duh)

Any idea what went wrong? What could I have done to prevent it? Is there a possibility my savings are all gone?

Since 2007 this has been done 3 times. One in 2007 (3 zeroes less), other in 2018 (5 zeroes less) and last one in Oct 2021 (6 zeroes less). So 14 zeroes less in less than 20 years.

Never actually tried participating in these, so are they actually legit and can you make money off them?

If so why not just participate in airdrops and swap into a big coin? It seems too good to be true and I don't really know if I should get into it.
If anyone can actually explain how these work and what are the steps to find ones that are real and legit.

Can you swap those coins into BTC or DOGE, and what are some plateforms that share available and upcoming drops.",0.89

2025-07-06,Where to buy XMR?,"Hey everyone,

I used eXch to swap XMR into BTC or USDT because it offered good privacy.   
  
Sadly, it seems to be offline now, and I’m not sure if it’s coming back. I’m looking for a solid alternative that works well for both small and large XMR swaps.  
  
 Preferably something non-custodial and fully decentralized I’m not interested in centralized platforms that track or block transactions. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.   
  
Thanks!

2025-07-06,"Ethereum Is the Internet of Value | Bitcoin Is Gold, But ETH Is Fueling the Future - DeFi, DAOs, RWAs, L2s and More.","Just crossed with this really interesting Leon [Tweet ](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1941496285506437375)about that Ethereum and Bitcoin can not be compared, something that I have been telling for ages, they are different things.

Ethereum is not just another crypto, it is the backbone of the decentralized future. It is programmable money, the infrastructure for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, Layer 2s, Real World Assets (RWAs), stablecoins and a much more.

Furthermore, all the decisions made by Ethereum ecosystem have been made to make Ethereum like it is today and to become what it is going to become. Since the shift to Proof of Stake, ETH is not low energy, yield generating and even deflationary at times with high activity. It is also really usable now with the blobs upgrade that even thought it increased inflation for a while it has drastically reduced gas fees and made Ethereum scalable for when it becomes mainstream and the whole world starts using it, making it again deflationary without no doubt. Holding ETH is like holding a piece of a decentralized Internet.

In the other hand we have Bitcoin, yes, it is the OG and respect to that. It has a fixed supply and no frills, lets call it Digital Gold. However it is ""static"". You can't build apps on it like Ethereum. No smart contracts, no ecosystem of dApps, no yield unless you take extra risk elsewhere.

While Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital oil, fueling a whole economy of innovation, experimentation and value creation.

Thousands of devs are building the future of Ethereum, from zk rollups to real world assets and the platform where this happen is Ethereum. Anyway, both are totally different things with totally different purposes so its a good way to ""diversify"".

We as shrimps dont have to pick sides, we just need to take advantage of opportunities to improve our lives and both are a must in a healthy portfolio.

2025-07-07,Does this intense froth worry you?,"in the 1980’s we had a saying “When the shoe shine boy gives you a stock tip get out of the market.” The market crashed, hard, in 1987. Right before that the froth was insane, grandmothers were telling to to buy specific stocks.

Im seeing that same degree of froth today with Bitcoin. Probably worse.

EVERYONE is talking about it. People in Reddit asking if they should take personal loans, mortgage their house and even foregoing a home purchase in lieu of BTC. It’s literally EVERYWHERE.

And then we have Michael Saylor. It seems that he just pulls predictions out of his ass with each one more outrageous than the last. This week it was “The most important number is 21. 21 Million in 21 years.”

The one reason why I’m holding my respectable position is because Trump media just raised $2.5 billion to buy BTC. I figure there’s no way he’s going to allow a loss and one or two right words from him, which I’m confident he’ll do, and it’s off to the races.

2025-07-13,I need to understand.,"At what point does BTC become a rich man’s game and retail gets locked out again?

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately and I’m genuinely confused. Wasn’t Bitcoin originally created to help the average person? 

To be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that bypasses traditional banking gatekeepers?

But here’s what I’m seeing:
	•	Transaction fees that can spike to $20+ during busy periods
	•	Lightning Network requiring technical knowledge most people don’t have
	•	Mining becoming dominated by massive industrial operations
	•	Institutional adoption driving prices to levels where a whole coin costs more than most people’s annual salary
	•	Self-custody requiring technical skills that intimidate regular users

I keep hearing that Bitcoin is “the best monetary system known to man” - and maybe it is from a technical standpoint. But if that’s true, why does it feel like we’re heading toward a system where only wealthy institutions and tech-savvy individuals can actually use it effectively?

The man on the street who Bitcoin was supposedly created for now needs:

	•	Expensive hardware wallets
	•	Deep technical knowledge of seed phrases, private keys, etc.
	•	Ability to navigate complex DeFi protocols
	•	Enough capital to make transaction fees worthwhile

Meanwhile, the same financial institutions that Bitcoin was meant to disrupt are now buying it up by the billions and potentially manipulating the market just like they do with everything else.
Am I missing something here? 

Is there actually a realistic path for regular people to use Bitcoin as intended, or are we just recreating the same exclusionary financial system with extra steps?

Would love to hear from people who’ve been in this space longer than me. Are there solutions I’m not seeing, or is this just the inevitable evolution of any successful monetary system?

TL;DR: Bitcoin feels like it’s becoming exactly what it was created to replace - a financial system that only works for the elite. Change my mind?",0.9936

2025-07-13,Taking profits,"I invested a chunk of money in 90% BTC/10% alts over the last 2 years with a cost basis of around BTC $65k USD.  Was DCAing in 2022-2024.  My strategy was, based on historic patterns related to the halving cycle, to DCA in during crypto winter (I was a bit late to the party, really ramped up my buys in '24) and take it out about 500 days after the halving.

Well, we're 450 days post-halving starting tomorrow, and 500 lands around Labor Day.  

Today, I'm opening up my DCA window, setting a few larger limit orders in the 125-130k range, and I'm going to take profits gradually over the next 3 months.  The Bitcoin I sold this morning earned me about 85% profit, which feels great.  It's a bit goofy that the S&P 500 would've given me about the same return over the same time horizon, but fortunately I invested in that, too.  

It's possible we could see a rise into the 130s or even 140k range or higher, and that would give me even bigger profits.  However, this late in the cycle, it's also possible we could see a cyclical top any day now.

Taking profits is always a risk, and I'm sure I'll feel a little FOMO if the price goes even higher after I've sold half my stack.  However, the risk/reward ratio right now looks right, and I'm proud of myself for sticking to my plan.  I've been burned in the last cycle waiting for just the right time to buy ('20, '22) or sell ('21, ETH in '24), and learned my lesson.

Here's a reminder to you all, especially newcomers, to remember to take profits.  Have an exit strategy, and stick to it.  Don't get left holding the bag when the bull market ends.  Upswings have been short and sweet this cycle.  Enjoy the green days while they last!",0.9879

2025-07-13,What is richminer.com?,"I saw an ad today for rich miner.  It is on various legitimate news websites, but I can't figure out the risk or catch here.

The contracts are fixed, it doesn't matter what the market does.

For example, you put in $15 contract and in 1 day you get back $15.60.  So, okay, 60 cents, whatever.

Or, on the other extreme, you put in a $50k contract and then in 45 days you get back 96k.  You double your 50k in 6 weeks???  I don't see how this is possible.

Can anyone shed any light on this?  I keep trying to figure out if this is a scam, or what is going on here.

There are a lot of major news outlets reporting on this startup, so it isn't just some random hacker making a website.  But, it really seems too good to be true.  I just want some proof one way or the other.

2025-07-14,"WARNING: ChangeNOW has been holding my funds hostage for over 2.5 months.

I swapped something for \~1 TAO (worth about $400 at the time), which then never appeared in my account. This is the complete log of my conversation with their support team since then. Only my personal information and their AI bot's messages have been removed.

**May 8**

**Me:** I need more help. I need to inquire about the status of a Pro Exchange I made to TAO which I haven't been able to access for days.

**Me:** Exchange Pro ID: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`

**Me:** The TAO seems to be inaccessible to me. I talked to support and they said they were working on it, but that was four days ago. If it's not getting fixed shortly, can I just get it reverted/refunded to something else?

**Anthony:** Thank you for providing the details. I am reviewing the issue - please give me a moment.

**Anthony:** Our team is still working on this case. At the moment, we don’t have any updates we can share with you.

**Me:** Can you simply refund it or send it on to an external address?

**Anthony:** In that case, we’re already working on processing the refund of your balance. Unfortunately, implementing the fix is taking some time.

**Me:** Okay... hours, days, weeks? I need to have some idea what to expect.

**Anthony:** I’ve requested an ETA from the team and will get back to you as soon as I receive it.

**Me:** Okay, thank you.

**May 12**

**Me:** I'd like an update on the status of my TAO exchange, or a refund. It's been a week now. (TX id: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`)

**Tim:** Hi, checking.

**Tim:** Unfortunately, we have not finished fixing the issue as of yet, we deeply apologize for the prolonged wait and the inconvenience caused. We completely understand that a week for this case is unacceptable. Your funds are completely safe. We will keep you updated.

**Me:** You can't even tell me if it'll be today or a month from now? I need something, here.

**Tim:** We have not received a fixed ETA for the fix yet. I am currently checking with our team for more specific information. Our team has let us know that they will provide us with the update either today or tomorrow. The issue will most likely be fixed in the following week. Again, we deeply apologize for the wait. We will contact you via this chat or e-mail once there is an update.

**Me:** Okay, good to hear, thank you.

**Tim:** Thank you for reaching out as well. We will do our best to fix the issue.

**May 19**

**Me:** This is me checking in a week later. I haven't heard anything and still don't see my TAO from exchange ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`.

**Alejandro:** Hi! Checking! No updates as of yet, sir/madam. Thank you lots for addressing us, we kindly ask you to wait a bit.

**Me:** I've been waiting for two weeks now. A week ago, they said they would have the update that day or the next, and it would most likely be fixed by now. I'm trying to be reasonable and patient, but at some point I'm going to have to start complaining loudly about this and hope it gets you guys to fix this. There's no way it should be taking this long for a simple fix or refund. Could someone explain to me the exact nature of the problem? Either the money is lost, in which case I should get a refund, or it's not, in which case it shouldn't be a challenge for one of your tech guys to forward the coins out of the address.

**Alejandro:** Checking with the team once again, one moment, please.

**Me:** Thank you.

**Alejandro:** The nature of the issue is that TAO is not supported at the moment but we'll find the resolution. Waiting for an update, one moment, please, we'll notify you.

**Me:** With Exchange Pro, you guys have custody of the money during the transfer. That means you have the TAO. Can't you simply send me its equivalent in ETH or BTC or whatever, and then you're welcome to take as long as you want working out the TAO problem?

**Alejandro:** ETA is the next week, sir/madam. It'll be done! Rest assured.

**Me:** Yes, you said that last week. What is the problem with what I suggested? You have the TAO. You're having problems with it. Just send me its value in some other coin, and keep it for yourself.

**Alejandro:** There are technical nuances that would be a problem. Our team will resolve this situation and you'll be notified as soon as it's done.

**Me:** Okay, but if it's still not done a week from now, I am going to start complaining loudly on forums and all that crap. Hopefully it won't come to that. Thanks, have a good day.

**Alejandro:** We assure you that the issue will be resolved, sir. It just needs a bit of waiting. Thank you so much for your patience, we sincerely appreciate it. Have a good one and keep in touch please.

**May 27**

**Me:** It's been yet another week. I hope this is resolved?

**Kate:** Hello! Could you please give a brief description of the issue?

**Me:** I've been waiting three weeks on my TAO from pro tx: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`. (See earlier conversation.)

**Kate:** That's odd. According to our records, the conversion with the ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]` has finished, the TAO should be in your account.

**Me:** Am I talking to an actual person? See the previous discussion with three other agents regarding this transaction. The TAO disappeared.

**Kate:** My apologies, let me check again. Our development team provided a new ETA - they said the issue is being worked on and should be resolved within this week. I'm very sorry for this inconvenience.

**Me:** You've been saying that every time since the first day. Again, since they are the ones that have the TAO, can they simply keep that and manually refund me the equivalent so that I can get this taken care of?

**Kate:** I will try to forward that request to our team, but since it's outside standard procedure, it will be most likely denied.

**Me:** Please do forward that request. Can you at the very least give me a firm ETA? You said it will be finished this week, so I will be able to get my money out by Friday? How about if not, they do a manual refund? I feel I have been reasonable, but this is getting ridiculous.

**Kate:** I'm sorry, but I'm working with the information that is being provided to me by our development team. They gave me an ETA of ""Within this week"". That's all I can say, unfortunately.

**Me:** Please pass along my request that they either ACTUALLY get it done this time, or go ahead and manually refund me. Thank you.

**June 14**

**Me:** It's a month and a half now and I've heard nothing and I *still* see no TAO from my pro tx `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`. This is totally unacceptable. What's the deal?

**Benjamin:** Hello, let me check. My apologise for delay. Still checking information. We apologise. I forwarded it over to the technical team, they are dealing with this issue. Please contact us with in next 2 days if your problem is not solved.

**Me:** It's been a month and a half. Every time I check in, I've been told it'll be fixed or I'll have an update within a day or two. What happens in 2 days when it's still not fixed, because I promise you it won't be. Just send me a simple goddamned refund or manually send it out, already, this is nuts.

**Benjamin:** We are very sorry that this is causing so much inconvenience. I've told the team to take care of your issue first.

**Me:** They've had a month and a half to take care of the issue. You have ownership of the coins, so just send me the equivalent, and then you can take as long as you want to fix your buggy code. Otherwise I'm out of ideas, and I'll post this on Reddit and hope somebody out there can help, or at least give you some bad press.

**Benjamin:** Your issue is being processed. We apologise for the long wait. Please contact us in 2 days if the problem is not resolved.

**Me:** And if it isn't resolved?

**Benjamin:** We will do our best to resolve this issue.

**Me:** So if it isn't resolved, you'll ask me to wait another two days. Do you have a supervisor or someone I can talk to? This should not be so fucking hard, and I'm out of patience.

**Benjamin:** My apologise for delay. Our tech team process this issue. Could you please provide me with your email to contact with you? Our tech team will be able to solve the problem by 07:00 a.m. (UTC). At which time we will write to you by mail as you will need a conversion from your side, which we will request manually and you will receive your funds.

**Me:** `[REDACTED_EMAIL]`

**Benjamin:** Thank you, we will write you.

**Me:** I'll be expecting it.

**Benjamin:** Thank you for understanding.

**June 18**

**Me:** It's been another few days, and I never got an email. Let me know if the problem's fixed now, or if we can go ahead with the refund.

**Anthony:** I’ve requested an update from the technical team regarding the resolution of your case and will get back to you as soon as I receive it. The team is currently exploring ways to convert your TAO token into another asset, which would allow you to withdraw your funds — even if in a different form. We’re actively working on this solution, and I’ll let you know as soon as there’s any progress.

**Me:** Good to hear, anything I can exchange would be just fine by me. So later today, or what?

**Anthony:** I expect to receive an update within 1–2 hours and will reach out to you to coordinate the next steps or inform you of any further developments.

**Me:** Excellent.

*(2 hours later)*

**Anthony:** I'm sorry to inform you, but unfortunately, it will not be possible to resolve this task within the next 24 hours, as much as we would like to. At the moment, the team has attempted to perform the required conversion, but the system is refusing to process it. To fix the issue, we will either need to integrate a patch or explore an alternative workaround. I have escalated the issue as far as currently possible, and the team will work even harder on this than before. I sincerely apologize, and we are aiming to resolve this matter by next Monday, June 23, or to propose another viable solution by then.

**Me:** Can you just agree that someone will just manually send me the equivalent coinage by then, if you haven't fixed the problem?

**Tony:** We will resolve the issue in any case - it’s only a matter of time. For now, we’re sticking to the previously mentioned timeframes, and moving forward, everything will be handled in accordance with our standard policies, without exceptions.

**Anthony:** Сompensation is an option. We are also considering it as a possible solution to the issue, but we will proceed with it only if we are unable to implement another resolution.

----

**June 29**

**Me:** Well, it's been another two weeks. Is it fixed, or can I kindly get my compensation now?

**Tony:** Hello! Could you please clarify in more detail what your question is about, so I can assist you more accurately? I see the previous chats; I will review them now.

**Me:** See previous conversation. In short: pro transaction `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`, I never got my TAO from it, and it was two months ago.

**Tony:** I have requested the information and will get back to you once we receive a response.

*(Later, a different agent responds)*

**Benjamin:** Hello, our tech team still working of this issue. We will contact with you within next 12 hours. Thank you for understanding.

**Me:** Yeah, I'll be holding my breath.

**Benjamin:** Thank you.

**June 30**

**Me:** It's been 12 hours, and I've not been contacted.

**Anthony:** Unfortunately, no update has been received by our team member within the past 12 hours. I’ll check the status of your case now. Great news! The technical team responsible for the issue has confirmed that a fix has been implemented to prevent such situations from happening again. They are now continuing to work on resolving the active cases to return funds to affected users. We’re currently awaiting an update.

**Me:** And when should I expect to hear about that?

**Anthony:** I’ve requested information regarding this matter and will get back to you with an update shortly. I haven’t received a specific ETA yet, but work is actively ongoing, so I’m hopeful we’ll get one within the next few hours.

**Me:** Okay, thanks.

**July 1**

**Me:** Well, it's been a few hours.

**Alejandro:** We'll notify you as soon as we get an update, sir/madam. I assure you that the process is being done by our team.

----

**July 7**

**Me:** It's been another week.

**Tim:** Hi, checking.

**Tessa:** Hi! Unfortunately there is no update at the moment. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused. Our team is still working on it.

----

**July 10**

**Me:** Get me a human. And is my refund ready?

**Alejandro:** Hi, sir/madam, unfortunately, no updates as of yet. Our team needs a bit more time to figure out the issue.

**Me:** And now?

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, it'll take some time for sure. Please wait for an update from us.

**Me:** I have been waiting for two and a half months. Please put me on with your supervisor.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, I'm here to help and guide you. You will be notified about any updates.

*Full disclosure: At this point I decide to explain the situation to ChatGPT, and have it advise on how to move forward, since I was getting nowhere.*

**Me:**

>Pro Exchange ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]` has been outstanding since 4 May—75 days without delivery.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, we understand your frustration and deeply apologise that it takes longer that you might have expected but such cases are complicated and require thorough viewing. We're kindly asking for your patience and understanding. Please, wait for an update from us.

**Me:** Acknowledgement noted, but a generic apology does not answer my request.

>**Action items (no later than 17:00 UTC 18 July):** 1. Confirm you have escalated this to a senior supervisor and provide their name, title, direct email, and your internal ticket/incident ID. 2. Give me a firm ETA in hours for one of the two outcomes already outlined:  • TAO sent to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or  • USDT/USDC/BTC/ETH refund to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, every single piece of information is forwarded. We cannot proceed with a refund unless the investigation is done and we don't provide such information. Thank you so much for understanding. We're kindly asking you to wait for an update.

**Me:** Alejandro — Your refusal to give supervisory contact or even a rough ETA after 75 days is unacceptable and violates basic consumer‑protection standards. This is my final notice before formal escalation.

>• Today, I will file complaints with FinCEN, the relevant Attorney General, and the Saint Vincent & the Grenadines FSA, and I will publish this entire chat log on Reddit, X/Twitter, and Trustpilot. • You have 4 hours from the timestamp of this message to prevent that by providing ONE of the following with a verifiable TX‑ID:  1) Full TAO transfer to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or  2) Refund in USDT/USDC/BTC/ETH to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, I promise you that our team is working on your request and we'll get to you with an update once we have one. Checking with the team, one moment.

**Me:** Alejandro—thanks for checking. I’ll wait 30 minutes for your concrete update. If I have neither a TX‑ID nor the supervisor’s contact by then, I’ll proceed with the formal complaints exactly as outlined.

**Alejandro:** Checked it, sir/madam. Our team is indeed working on resolving this situation but I'm afraid we cannot give ETA here.

**Me:** Alejandro — I’ve asked repeatedly for two very simple things — (1) a supervisor’s contact and (2) an ETA in hours. You’ve declined both. Per my prior notice, I am now proceeding with formal complaints to FinCEN, the relevant Attorney General, and other regulators, and will publish this chat log publicly. You can still stop that paperwork only by providing, within the next 2 hours:

>• a verifiable TX‑ID for either  a) the TAO transfer to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or  b) a refund in USDT/USDC/WBTC/ETH to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam,it'll unfortunately take a bit more time for our team to complete your request. Please, kidnly asking you to wait a bit. We promise that it'll be done and you'll be notified about it.

**Me:** I've kindly waited for 75 days. You've got just over an hour left.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, please kindly understand, this cannot be done in some hours. We need a nit more time to do a research and understand how to resolve this.

**Me:** YOU'VE HAD TWO AND A HALF MONTH. How you RESOLVE it is sending me MY MONEY. It's not goddamned rocket science.

**Me:** I'm going to go ahead and start posting about this. If I get my money before tomorrow, I'll take them down, but otherwise, I'll go ahead with alerting the regulatory agencies in the morning.",0.9997

2025-07-14,SUI quietly delivers a +125% run — without the hype,"While BTC, PENGU and others dominate the news cycle, SUI has been building in the background - and it's starting to show.

* Price: $3.87 (+10.8% in 24h)
* Volume: $2.65B (+180%)
* All-time growth: +125.93%
* Circulating Supply: 3.45B out of 10B
* Market Cap: $13.4B

Sui doesn’t rely on hype cycles - it’s a tech-focused L1 chain with its own Move-based architecture, optimized for scalability and parallel execution.

Many traders are spotting consistent liquidity on exchanges like Binance, WhiteBIT, and OKX. That’s a sign of real activity, not just speculation.

We often chase ATH. But sometimes, the best plays are the ones building quietly, with fundamentals that are only now catching up in price.

However, the government sold the Bitcoin in 2018, now worth over $25.24 billion, exceeding the country's public debt of $24 billion. Experts speculate that the sale was motivated by unfamiliarity with Bitcoin's value and volatility, and some believe that holding a long-term reserve of Bitcoin could have provided benefits.

2025-07-18,I’ve been buying Hex since 2021…,"And it’s forever gone down.

I am pure degenerate.

I believe this coin has the legs to run, the community to support it, and the founder to bootstrap it.

I believe Richard Heart moved the 80k BTC.

I believe when he said he mined 300k BTC in 2011 back when he live-streamed in 2019 era.

I believe we will see the most epic pump after Eth tops.

I think the hex community has received the most hate and ridicule, but throughout everything, they are still here and believe harder than ever that Richard Heart made the best crypto products (and is still making them…. Liberty finance . Swap)

I’ll break down the 3 best things in crypto land and what Richard Heart saw in them that could be tweaked to be perfect.

1) Bitcoin.  People wanted to earn yield, so they gave their Bitcoin to exchanges for the promise of 5% yield.  Guess what, those exchanges got hacked and ppl lost their BTC.  Guess who warned you of Gemini, Celcius, FTX, etc?  Richard.

He actually saw this trend before it even started in 2019, and he launched hex in December 2019.  Which was .00001, and it’s still up 100x today.

So this guy Richard thought, hmmm wouldn’t it be cool if we could earn yield on our bitcoin by just time-locking it?  Meaning, no electricity, no burning our resources, no pollution.  Just the radical idea of instead of proof of work, it’s proof of wait.  

The money used to buy ASICs, electricity, and the time spent waiting for a block to be mined, this could all be done with a simple contract.  A hybrid proof of stake/ proof of wait.

So hex is born.

2) Ethereum.  Best product that crypto has offered.  Period.  Bitcoin is cool, but it’s pet rock.  It can’t do sheet.  Ethereum is the bad ass younger brother that made mami and paps proud.  

But them gas fees yo.  Every bull market has this issue, where it’s so good but no one can use it.

Hence why pulsechain was designed to help with ethereum’s load.  It’s not some L2 that is centralized on one dudes node.

It’s world wide. No one can turn it off.  And it’s faster and cheaper than Ethereum.  So now Ethereum can test all the upgrades that allow hackers to drain your wallets, while Pulsechain can wait to decide if they will implement.  Best of all worlds.  

Pulsechain is born.

3) Uniswap.  Did you know uni token should be hundreds of dollars per coin rn?  There’s this neat little feature called the buy and burn, but Hayden is too busy gargling demon semon to flick that switch.  All UNI token holders are getting kucked.

So Richard made PLSX.  Buy and burn features TURNED ON, and cannot be turned off.  It’s the drunken michael Saylor buying the PLSX token forevermore with every swap that occurs on Pulsechain. 

With $50 mil daily volume, and this is in a bear market, AND everybody hates the chain.  Imagine with some adoption what numbers we could see…


So these are the 3 pillars of crypto that have really pushed the industry forward, but they all lacked a crucial element.  But Richard heart, the mysterious whale who mined bitcoin in 2011, made copies of the best things and gave them the little tweak they needed to be great.


RH believes in decentralization, freedom to transact, freedom of middlemen, and freedom to pump to the heavens.

What other meme coin can boast such stats?

I like this billionaire crypto dude who likes to make products that are upgrades to the 15 year old tech and are central to the core principles of crypto.  Freedom to transact.

Oh ya, and pDAI…. Nvm, you’ll find out soon enough.

2025-07-20,Any idea what I was farming?,"Looking to do a bit of digging. I would say somewhere between 2013-2014 I started mining crypto with GPUs, not a crazy setup but used 2 high end gaming PCs then setup 3 less powerful but still usable farming rigs. 
Now I have no idea what coin was being farmed, I just recall we did it for 3 months as we didn’t have to pay for electric and GPUs back then, not too crazy. It wasn’t BTC but I just assume a coin that soon followed. 

Now what doesn’t help is I really can’t remember much more other than not knowing how to withdraw or take it to something usable at the time and assume it could still be there. 

I do think at that time it would have been something hardware based so assume if I worked on some clues I could find old sata mechanical drives and start doing some digging. I do get the weird feeling I could log in via a client or website to see how it was getting on my phone then also have a weird memory of having to be part of a pool… again this may be mixed up memory’s. I tried searching my emails at the time for keywords but really can’t find anything. 

I’m hoping some people may have some leads. Long shot but I assume even 3 months of mining something back in that time may have some value, if it’s not gone.

2025-07-21,Joint Donation Drive: r/CryptoCurrency & r/EthTrader Unite to Defend Roman Storm – and Crypto’s Future,"Hey r/CryptoCurrency 

We’re joining forces with r/ethtrader for a community-driven donation drive to support the legal defense of Roman Storm, co-founder of Tornado Cash. This isn’t just about one developer — it’s about defending privacy, open-source development, and the very principles that make Ethereum and crypto possible.

# Why This Matters

Roman is facing years in prison for publishing open-source privacy software — tools anyone could freely use. At the time, the only official guidance (from FinCEN) said developers of such software weren’t money transmitters. Yet in August 2023, U.S. authorities arrested him, charging conspiracy, unlicensed money transmission, and sanctions violations.

The DOJ’s narrative misrepresents the facts:

* Roman and his co-founder ""never operated a service"" — they only published code.
* They added filters in their web wallet code to block sanctioned addresses but couldn’t control forks of their software.
* The prosecution hinges on a ""novel legal theory"": that ""money transmission"" applies even without custody of funds.

This case sets a dangerous precedent: if developers can be punished for misuse of open-source code, innovation and privacy in crypto are at risk. The First Amendment protects code as speech — yet prosecutors treat it like an afterthought, even resorting to absurd analogies (comparing money transmission to ""a frying pan conducting heat"").

# The Situation Now

Roman’s trial began July 14, 2025, in Manhattan. What was expected to last 2 weeks may now stretch 3-4, with skyrocketing costs for expert witnesses, research, and legal fees. The defense fund urgently needs ""another $1.5M"" to sustain the fight.

The Ethereum Foundation has stepped up with ""$500K"" and will ""match community donations up to $750K"" — doubling your impact.

# How You Can Help

Visit [https://freeromanstorm.com](https://freeromanstorm.com/) to donate. Options include:

* ""Juicebox"": ETH donations
* ""Giveth"": ETH, L2 tokens, SOL (no fees)
* ""We Want Justice DAO"": Fiat via wire
* ""Free Roger Ver site"": BTC, BCH, most L1s (no KYC)
* ""Farcaster"": Crypto contributions
* ""Geyser Fund"": BTC (incl. Lightning) and credit cards

Every contribution counts. Together, we can stand for privacy, open-source, and the rights of developers everywhere.

Questions? Drop them below. Share this post far and wide—we need the entire crypto community to rally.

I managed to figure out how to pay.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, im new to crypto and need it to pay for smt.

I got a few infos from the seller on where to and how to pay, and one of them was the following:

“In case your crypto exchange asks for the recipient’s name, state your own name and that you are sending coin to your own self-custodial wallet like ‘Exodus’ or ‘Cake Wallet’”

Now, I’m currently using Crypto.com(?) And when i try to withdraw the amount i need (fraction of a BTC) and try to send it to the sellers wallet, it does ask me for the recipient name n stuff

So i enter my own name n stuff, but when i try to select the Wallet type, it doesn’t have this ""Exodus or Cake Wallet” stuff..?

Is there smt else i can/should select instead? Or is there some other way i can do it?",0.2755

Its time to share your biggest crypto blunders. Whether its stolen crypto, lost in a trade, sold too early, etc…Let it out here and suffer with your bros.

I’ll start:
I got into crypto in 2017 as literally the entire top 50 was starting to run (IIRC ETH to $50-70). My trade thesis was simple: “what hasnt pumped yet?” did about a days worth of research and subsequently dumped $20k into XRP. First got in about $10k in at 0.006 cents and it pumped to like 7cents a week later. Bought another $10k on the retrace back to 2.5cents. 

Held thru the 2018 short lived pumped to $3. Didnt sell a penny. Blockfolio said $6mm.

Held thru all the way until SEC sued Ripple and that shook me to the core. Couldnt hodl after that and sold. I still came out in significant profit from my initial capital. Took a few hundred $k’s out over a few months, put back into BTC and ETH before the 2021 run up.

Somehow made it back to $2.5mm. Held. Lost mostly all of it on the dump into bear market.

Started the current cycle with very few wins. Started dabbling in shit coins, memes, etc... Long story short, im down to 4-figures in crypto. While i got way more out of the market than what I put in, its still devastating. 

How much would I have if I just held XRP until today? $8mm. Thats beyond life changing for me. I would’ve changed lives of not only my immediate family but many relatives and very close friends.

2025-07-23,My Zcash Investment Thesis - Frank Braun,"This was a good read. I think I'm going 50% into ZEC.   
  
It's undervalued by any metric. By the time any thesis is popular most of the profit has been made. Privacy coins are so low compared to other market segments & it's the original Cypherpunk ethos. Satoshi would approve. 

\--------------------------------------------

  
**""This is not financial advice and just my personal analysis. Please do your own research.**

I simply share my analysis of why I think that Zcash (ZEC) might be a good investment mid- to long-term as a high beta play, this post is not an ideological debate on which cryptocurrency is best.

It's also not meant as input for short-term trading, I'm not interested in that and I think nobody knows if a coin is going to go up, down, sideways or in circles in the short-term, least of all crypto influencers (unless they orchestrate the pump themselves).

# Starting point

Bitcoin is king and it's sucking in more capital than a drunken Saylor could spend.

The narrative has shifted from electronic cash to *store of value* (SoV) and *digital gold*, with the [mempool](https://mempool.space/) being pretty empty, resulting in low on-chain transaction fees.

The launch of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF [IBIT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf) with currently $83.7B AUM is considered the most successful ETF launch *in history*.

The U.S. seems to be set on printing again and there isn't really an alternative to that either.

**Nothing stops this train.**

That means number go up for Bitcoin, the obvious move under these macro conditions. With gold being the conservative choice, who just outperformed the S&P500 in the last 25 years, which is pretty remarkable.

Ethereum and Solana have both been underperforming Bitcoin recently and to me it still remains unclear why value should accrue to their respective tokens.

Retail seemed to be mostly gambling in meme coins now, culminating in [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/) recently raising $500M in 12 minutes. Or $600M, nobody seems to be exactly sure, but who's counting between friends?

Crypto Twitter seems to be pretty dead right now, given how much Bitcoin is pumping. Retail is dead, the institutions are here, and they are not shitposting on X.

# A privacy renaissance?

Meanwhile, the word on the street is that AML regulations are getting out of control. It's getting harder and harder for everyday people and businesses to move legitimate money around and the banks are spending *at least* 10 dollars in compliance cost for every dollar frozen.

People have a hard time buying houses if the money came from crypto.

Interacted with a mixer six years go? Please explain yourself.

The EU is leading the way again in regulation with MiCA, the only area where the EU seems to be leading these days. This lead to many exchanges delisting privacy coins.

# Why should privacy coins outperform?

I think it's safe to say that Bitcoin has been institutionalized. Bitcoin Maxis are cheering for Michael Saylor, ETFs, and even strategic Bitcoin reserves, ignoring that they will be the ones paying for the Bitcoins in the reserve. Or the ones from whom the Bitcoin for the reserves will be confiscated.

There are various L2 solution trying to add privacy to Bitcoin, I'll write in another post why I don't think these will add privacy to Bitcoin in any meaningful way. I hope I'm wrong, though, and projects like [Fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) and [Cashu](https://cashu.me/) get mainstream adoption.

The problem with cypherpunks and privacy geeks like myself is that we tend to extrapolate our own preferences to the general population, which usually isn't true and leads to terrible investment decisions.

Swapping Bitcoin for Monero, because it has better privacy, didn't work out well in the last couple of years, Monero is still down -35% from it's last all-time high over 4 years ago, while Bitcoin is chasing one all-time high after another.

So was it fundamentally wrong or was it just too early?

Will there be a renaissance in privacy coins, or even a privacy super cycle, as some call it?

# Will Bitcoin dominate forever?

As I said in the beginning, Bitcoin is king and has it all going for it: the network effects, brand recognition, regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, you name it, and Bitcoin got it.

The only thing that Bitcoin definitely doesn't have is a good L1 privacy story and it will most likely never get it. We can be happy if we get the necessary quantum resistance updates in time. It's extremely unlikely we'll get any meaningful privacy upgrades on the L1 protocol layer, given the ossification of Bitcoin.

Currently, privacy coins only compromise a tiny fraction of the total crypto market cap (stable coins excluded): The leading privacy coin Monero has only \~1/380th the market cap and the second largest one, Zcash, only \~1/3300th.

So why should that number, the relative fraction of privacy coins in the overall market cap of crypto, go up? Why should there be real market demand for privacy coins outside of cypherpunks and hardcore privacy activists?

It's already clear that for every use case where people want real privacy they prefer privacy coins, usually Monero, over Bitcoin. [Archetyp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetyp_Market), one of the leading and longest running dark net markets, was Monero only, had 612,000 users and allegedly did 250M Euro in revenue.

So why should the demand for privacy coins go up relative to the demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? And while payment usage is nice, it doesn't necessarily mean value accrual to the token. Why should that change?

* The market cap of Bitcoin is $2.3T
* The market cap of gold is $22T
* Total global asset value is [\~$1,000T](https://x.com/Croesus_BTC/status/1919385198795338165)
* That is, the market cap of Bitcoin is \~1/10th of gold and \~0.2% of total assets
* The market cap of all privacy coins ([CoinGecko category](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)) is $8.4B
* The market cap of Monero is $6B
* The market cap of Zcash is $0.7B
* Undeclared/hidden offshore wealth is estimated to be *at least* $10T, so *at least* 1% of global asset value
* That is, the **market cap of all privacy coins is less than \~0.1% of offshore wealth**

Due to increasing AML regulation it's getting harder and harder to move offshore wealth into real estate, a classic vehicle for that purpose due to, among other things, its ability to generate yield.

Quickly moving funds in and out of privacy coins won't give you good privacy, because sums can be correlated and fund movements can be timed. That's a generic argument why value should accrue to privacy coins over time, if the market decides to adopt them more to store offshore wealth. This will probably require the ability to generate yield which in turns requires deeper integration into the wider DeFi ecosystem.

Another driving factor for the adoption of privacy coins, outside of tax optimization strategies, is that [$5 wrench attacks](https://xkcd.com/538/) are on [the rise](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks).

All the KYC & AML regulations mean that the personal details of users **and** their net worth is spread far and wide into numerous databases, from where they can easily be exfiltrated, sometimes with hacks, social engineering, or simple [bribery](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists).

Users still get phishing emails and even physical letters related to the Ledger email leak that happened years ago.

So hiding wealth becomes more and more important, not just for people evading taxes, but also for everyday people rightly worried about their physical security.

# Zcash vs. Monero

As has been argued in [another post](https://frankbraun.org/t-addr), Zcash has better privacy if shielded transactions are used, but only 19.5% of ZEC in circulation are currently in shielded pools. That's quickly increasing due to the ""Zashi effect"" and due to the support for shielded transactions in the [Keystone](https://keyst.one/). Ledger support for shielded transactions is [in the making](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-path-forward-for-ledger-and-zcash/50951).

Holding ZEC in a shielded pool for a long time gives you better privacy, thereby increasing demand for the token. Higher TVL in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for anonymizing larger amount of funds, thereby increasing demand for ZEC. It's a virtuous privacy cycle, if the market decides to adopt it.

Monero currently has the lead over Zcash, with a 8.5x larger market cap, but with inferior privacy if you compare Zcash shielded transaction to default Monero transactions. At least until FCMP++ is released and the verdict of cryptographers is out on the privacy properties of FCMP++ over zero-knowledge proofs.

# The importance of UX

Monero is often perceived as more community-led and grass-roots while Zcash is perceived as more corporate and venture capital driven. Assessing these claims is out of scope for this post, but I want to share an observation I made over the years.

Open-source has been really effective in delivering superior ""base layer"" infrastructure components: The Linux kernel, the GCC compiler, various programming languages, etc.

But it's usually very bad at delivering world-class UX, these usually come from companies, Apple being the most famous example.

I think that's due to the fact that having a lot of nerds tweak some technology like a kernel or a compiler will lead to superior performance (they are also their own users), but it won't create a great UX. Nerds don't use that layer that much (they live more in the command line), but, more importantly, a great UX needs a unifying vision, usually a single leader, and the willingness to make hard calls and listen to the end user.

Given that Zcash currently has the better base technology (Monero is catching up with FCMP++), the war for the end user is won in the UX, and there [Electric Coin Company](https://electriccoin.co/) under Josh Swihart is currently leading the way with [Zashi](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/).

The typical person storing offshore wealth is usually not a privacy geek, but more your regular end user that values great UX and already has a Ledger.

# Privacy is necessary for commerce

Most cryptocurrencies, including stable coins, have terrible privacy. Using them is leaks a lot more data (or more precisely, it leaks data to a lot more people) than using wire transfers or credit card transactions.

The term *public ledger* often used for blockchains gives it away: Making **one** payment to a business allows you to derive a lot of information about that business, especially when professional chain analysis software is used.

You can potentially see the total revenue of a business, their customers, their suppliers, how much they pay their employees, and what their cashflow and runway is.

For example, there is good reason why a lot of HR departments consider the pay structure one of the most closely guarded secrets of the company. If you start paying your employees with crypto (including stable coins), employees can easily see all other payments, just in pseudonymized form.

Bank secrecy laws and consumer data protection laws (like GDPR) exist for a reason. I'm not a lawyer, but I would argue that exposing all of that data clashes with some of these regulations.

**Commerce simply doesn't work without privacy.**

Just as the World Wide Web (using the HTTP protocol) needed an encryption layer first (leading to HTTPS) before it became viable for business, the payment layer of the internet needs privacy in order to function properly. See also: [Zcash, the HTTPS of Blockchains](https://balajis.com/p/zcash-the-https-of-blockchains) (originally published in January 2020).

And while crypto currencies have a lot of advantages over traditional payment methods, if it really catches on for commerce, the disadvantages of not having privacy will become more widely known and that might tip the scale in favor of privacy coins.

For a store of value privacy might not be that important in some contexts, but for actual commerce (which includes *payments*), what's needed is *unstoppable private money*.

# Halvings

Zcash is about two halving cycles behind Bitcoin. While inflation in Bitcoin became very low (sub 1%) after 4 halvings, inflation in Zcash just became manageable after the second halving, which pushed it down from an annual inflation of \~12.5% to \~4.2% and that occurred less than a year ago in November 2024. This might serve as a catalyst for Zcash in the current bull market, given that the effects of halvings usually lag behind by a year to 18 months.

The next halving will make the inflation rate good, comparable to gold and the target inflation rate of most central banks, namely \~2%.

And after the fourth halving the inflation rate will be a very good sub \~1%.

Bitcoin had the first mover advantage which allowed it a very slow price discovery in its first years after genesis. Zcash was launched in a market that was already quite speculative, but with the same coin issue schedule and no premine, which meant that the initial price was very high (due to very limited circulating supply in the beginning) and then was hit with 4 years of very high inflation, which lead to constant sell pressure, and makes the price chart look terrible if one doesn't take these factors into account. But from a today's perspective that's another argument for this asymmetric bet.

# Tracking

Of course, picking a start date to track an investment thesis is kind of arbitrary, different start dates can lead to vastly different results. But picking one is better than none, so let's go with the prices from the date of the first draft of this post on 2025-07-16:

* BTC: 118844.42 USD
* XMR: 334.72 USD
* ZEC: 44.23 USD

Let's circle back in a year or so and check how it's going.

# Conclusion

If the network effects of Bitcoin dominate everything or the market decides that privacy doesn't matter, both Monero and Zcash should underperform Bitcoin.

If privacy coins become more important, relative to the total crypto market, both Monero and Zcash should overperform Bitcoin, given that they are currently #1 and #2 in the privacy coin market, together comprising \~80% of it (according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)).

Given that Zcash is only 1/8.5th of the market cap of Monero, has the better privacy tech, and is quickly making UX advances with a structurally better setup to make them, makes it an asymmetric opportunity with the potential to outperform both Monero and Bitcoin over the mid- to long-term.

Which is why I consider Zcash as the highest beta play in the privacy space.

**It has the potential to become a private capital attractor.** Holding capital in a shielded pool long-term makes it more private. Higher TVL in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for private capital. It's a great flywheel.

The largest risks I see is that Monero quickly catches on with FCMP++ and better UX, or that the recent quick UX advances in Zcash slow down. For example, due to lack of funding for Electric Coin Company, because recent [changes to the Zcash funding model](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-community-shapes-the-future-of-development-funding/) mean that ECC doesn't automatically receive ""protocol funding"" anymore.

Commerce needs unstoppable private money, but how much it can be adopted in the mainstream also depends a lot on the development of the regulatory landscape, which will have quite some influence on the entire privacy coin category.

I guess only time will tell and ultimately the market decides in aggregate, not the individual bag holder.

Yeah, the tech is cool but if you step back for a few minutes you might be able to see just how dangerous it is for our personal freedoms. ETH more so than BTC. Over the past six months an unprecedented amount of our personal data that has always been segmented into individual silos has been correlated into single and very broad reaching individual dossiers. I’m talking everything, biometrics, spending, online conduct including social media, employment, voting, civil conduct… I’m talking absolutely EVERYTHING. The uprising of the “Tech Bros” is a very real thing. For those that aren’t aware I’d invite you to do some research on Peter Thiel and Palantir. This is the company whose stock shot up from $12 to $145 in just months. All because they are doing, under Federal contracts, exactly what I’ve described.

Now not only are we about to surrender our money to the “Tech Bros” they have an extremely friendly government behind them. I’ve made my entire career based on Tech from the age of 17 and my philosophy has always been “what‘s next” and I’ve made a very successful career doing that, mostly hooking up with specific management teams doing start-ups And what I’m absolutely 100% confident about is that these technologies will indeed replace our fiat currency. Especially ETH and stablecoins. BTW, I’m buying as much as I possibly can and I know that you’ve watched the insane amount of corporate and institutional inflows, well, that’s for a reason. How many of you have read The Genius Act? That is some scary legislation.

👉 The SEC rejected Bitwise’s “10 ex-BTC/ETH” altcoin ETF and XRP was reportedly the main reason for the rejection.

That kind of killed the altcoin ETF momentum before it even started. And if that rejection holds weight, it could send a broader signal to institutions: stick with BTC, for now.

It made me think , what happens when ETF-driven liquidity is denied access to alts like XRP?

Well, it has to go somewhere. And the safest, most ""institutionally correct"" place? Bitcoin.

I’m not saying XRP is dead  far from it. I actually think it’ll have its moment eventually. But when ETF doors are slammed shut, market narratives adjust.

That’s why I wouldn’t be surprised if we see:

• More rotations from alts back to BTC

• BTC dominance ticking back up

• Choppy price action on majors like XRP to trap both sides


If you look at ETF flows right now, BTC is eating up the attention. And this rejection might’ve just added more fuel to that.

Not financial advice obviously, but I’m keeping a closer eye on BTC now. Feels like it’s quietly preparing to take the lead again while everyone else is distracted.

2025-07-24,Report Shows 45% Increase in User Holdings for Bitcoin (BTC) in Bitget's July Proof-of-Reserves,"No surprise in the BullRun though, but according to the PoR public figures published, BTC held by users grew from 6,594 BTC in June to 9,531 BTC in July. A sharp increase in user-held Bitcoin, with BTC balances surging over 45% month-on-month in July. 

thats the strongest growth across all major assets tracked on the platform... 

USDT holdings also experienced a notable increase of 21%, climbing from approximately 1.61 billion to nearly 1.95 billion. ETH balances rose by 31% month-on-month, from 148,754 ETH to 195,466 ETH, while USDC holdings grew by 14%.

They are also incentivizing users to buy and trade more assets with their Bitget Trading Club Championship which just went live hours after the report...

""This increase in on-platform user assets, especially Bitcoin, shows a bit of the broader trend in user behavior, where traders and institutions increasingly may favor exchanges that allow independent asset verification,"" said **Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget**.

another report i saw somewhere showed a spike in the google search for Bitcoin which shows that adoption is rising across the industry...

But it's becoming a bit too common.  What is the real story?

It's not some guy getting out of prison.  The recent wallet had BTC at 37 pennies.  That wasn't some underground dollars changing hands.

No one held that long- that was at least 7-10 years they could have been living like a millionaire.

We don't think there is a quantum computer that could run the calculation, though that day approaches closer and we don't see all the developments.  People think they would go after banks, but if you can only crack one code every 45 days, and the rule is if you have the key, you are the owner, then that's the best and least risky target out there.

ETH - 25%
LINK - 15%
SOL - 10%
XRP - 10%

To be honest I don’t have much of a thought process on these other than they seem to have the highest upside for adoption by current real world institutions and assets. Obviously BTC effectively being the gold standard of the cryptocurrency market is why it will hold such a high percentage.

2025-07-28,What Nobody Tells You About ‘Buying Early’,"I always wonder if people were like, “if I had bought something (a token) at $1, I would have been rich by now” though I might have even said it once or twice. But let’s be real with ourselves. After looking into it with more eyes and some level of experience, I noticed that Most of us would have sold at $10 or maybe $50 tops. Considering the normal human nature.

I’ve thought about it a lot and honestly, if I were there back then, I probably wouldn’t have held through either. Because the truth is, in those early days, nobody really knew what stuff like BTC would become. There was no DeFi, no NFTs, none of the stuff we now use every day. It was just another risky bet in a sea of random coins.

If someone in 2016 told me that a a particular blockchain token would one day power billion dollar apps, be used in real world payments, and be part of actual finance, i would have looked at them like they were crazy. And that’s why I don’t really vibe with all those “if you bought 1k back then” tweets. People weren’t fortune tellers. We all were just experimenting.

And if I’m being honest, if my 1k had turned into 10k early on, I would have probably sold it. Not even probably, i know it’s a sure thing. Maybe use it to buy a laptop or handle some life things, because at that time, that return would have felt huge. And I won’t even think about the next five years when i’n staring at life changing money in the moment.

So yeah, I had stopped beating myself up about not being early. That mindset doesn’t and cannot help me anyone. What I focus on now is simple. Learn what’s in front of me, take positions I understand, and take profit when it makes sense. And i believe there is no shame in that. This game isn’t about who got in first. It’s about who’s still standing in the long run.

And that’s just how I see it.",0.9171
2025-07-28,"Bitcoin weekly market update, 28 July 2025","**Bitcoin consolidated for another week.**

In tradfi, stock markets across the world had a good week and overall everything looks great. In the US, both the S&P500 and the more tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 closed at new all time highs. There is simply nothing bearish about tradfi right now. Which is exactly where we want it to be for crypto to do well.

Turning to bitcoin. After breaking out two weeks ago, it has now spent two weeks consolidating in a narrow range between about $116k and $120k. On Friday, The capital management firm [Galaxy Digital announced](https://investor.galaxy.com/news/news-details/2025/Galaxy-Executes-One-of-the-Largest-Notional-Bitcoin-Transactions-Ever/default.aspx) that they had successfully completed the selling of over 80,000 BTC on the behalf of an early bitcoin whale. Part of this sale was likely what caused the dip on early Friday morning.

The fact that the market could absorb an enormous sale like this and still not move down much is a very good sign. Purely looking at the bitcoin chart, it tells the same story: very much still bullish, with a conservative price target of $142k.

In the altcoin space, this week we saw a pullback across the board. So far this looks like a healthy correction, with nothing yet to suggest that the recent altcoin rally has peaked.

In summary, my view remains that this bull market is far from over. Let’s see what the next week brings!

I’ve been shouting about TRON (TRX) for years — and all I got was eye-rolls, condescension, and the classic “lol TRON is a joke” responses. You know who you are. People thought I was crazy for backing a project that didn’t have the flash of Ethereum or the hype of Solana. But guess what? I'm laughing now.

TRON is quietly becoming one of the most used blockchains on the planet. Look at the on-chain data: daily active users, stablecoin transfers (especially USDT), DeFi activity — it’s all there. TRON consistently ranks top 3 in total value transferred. It dominates in stablecoin movement, especially across Asia and developing markets. People use it because it works, it’s fast, and dirt cheap to transact. While other chains were fighting over NFT royalties and gas fees, TRON just kept building.

TRON is now the #1 chain for USDT transactions by volume. That’s not a meme, that’s real utility. Just because it's not plastered all over YouTube influencer thumbnails doesn’t mean it's not delivered!


You all laughed when I stacked TRX under 2 cents. You said it was vaporware. Now it's part of national-level blockchain pilots, integrated across wallets, exchanges, and dApps, and climbing the ranks quietly but relentlessly.

2025-07-29,The 51% attack problem and how networks have overcome the problem!,"

We’ve been seeing recent news with coins/tokens such as even Monero (XMR) being vulnerable to a 51% attack. A large XMR mining group/pool Qubic shared with the world that they will attempt a takeover of the Monero network by using the 51% attack. They would have EASILY succeeded in the attack, if they did not announce publicly that they were doing the 51% attack, the community got together and was able to stop the 51% attack.

https://preview.redd.it/oky2q83aluff1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef7568d83918a7e35b526ef15996cf4476190a1

Thankfully, Ethereum is much less vulnerable to a 51% attack with recent upgrades, but how and why?

# First of all, what is a 51% attack exactly?

51% attack can happen when one group or entity has control of greater than 50% of the validating power or mining power of the network, making that group or entity the central authority.

# Is it really that bad to have a centralized group with greater than 50% of the validating or mining power?

Yes!

1.      With at least 51% of the validating or mining power, the entity can “double-spend” coins or tokens and this is done by reversing transactions that the group has made.

2.      They have the power of preventing new transactions from being confirmed or validated which censors users. Essentially they can pick and choose, that is a BIG NO NO (ahhh I’ve been doing too much baby talk lately IRL haha)

3.      The group can have a monopoly on the mining rewards or stop others from validating the block! That does not sound good because IT ISN’T!

4.      The entity can rewrite the blockchain history by making chains that are longer than the honest participants! WOW, that is a HUGE red flag!

# Proof of Work, why is it vulnerable to 51% attack?

Proof of Work relies on the miners that are competing to solve the puzzle or equation using their computational power which has inherent weaknesses.

1.      The greater the mining power one has, the more influence you have on the network, making the network dependent on hash rate.

2.      Pooled mining teams or mining farms are larger, hence more control to the bigger and wealthier groups.

3.      When chains are smaller with low volume of network participants, a group can overpower the network for cheap! (Recommend reading up on Bitcoin Gold, they have had MULTIPLE 51% attacks…)

4.      Slashing is not available, even when a miner or group is found to have malicious behavior. The only punishment they get is possibly losing trust…

**Just imagine, if someone has more than 50% of the hash rate on the network, they can win every coin toss game because they can bring their own coin that is biased for them to win! THAT’S CHEATING!**

# How is Proof of Stake less vulnerable to 51% attack?

Thankfully Ethereum has moved on from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake with recent upgrades! Instead of being dependent on hardware for mining, they selected validators determined from the quantity of the coin or token they are staking.

1.      In Proof of Stake, the user or group needs to control at least 51% of the staked coin or token, which can be quite expensive such as BILLIONS OF DOLLARS for most high market cap coins or tokens. This is extremely difficult to achieve compared to just controlling at least 51% of the validating or mining power!

2.      Proof of Stake actually has slashing penalties for malicious behavior by burning their stake! In Proof of Work, they only lose trust, what is HUGE improvement!

3.      Validators are selected in random to prevent power from being concentrated or centralized and takes away the predictability factor!

4.      Socially, users can coordinate to fork away from malicious users and further penalize them! Users WANT attackers to try because they can burn away their stake and fortune hehe

2025-07-31,Looking for a Payment Gateway That Converts Credit Card Payments into Crypto Automatically (Easy Enough for Grandma),"I run an e-commerce store and want to start accepting crypto, but there’s a big catch—most of my customers have zero knowledge about setting up wallets, exchanges, or connecting accounts. If the process is even slightly complicated, they’ll bail.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

* Customer pays using their **credit/debit card** like a normal purchase.
* On the backend, the payment is **automatically converted into crypto**.
* The crypto goes straight into **my e-commerce wallet** (BTC, ETH, USDT, etc.).
* **No crypto account setup required** for the customer—should be as easy as buying on Amazon.

Does a solution like this exist today?

* If yes, which services do this seamlessly?
* If not, what’s the **closest alternative** out there? (e.g., services like MoonPay, Ramp, or others?)

Looking for something **plug-and-play**, low-friction, and ideally available to merchants without complex licensing hoops.

Any recommendations or real-world experiences would be hugely appreciated!",0.9885
2025-07-31,"Trump’s Crypto Report Is Out - No Bitcoin Reserve, But Real Policy Moves","https://preview.redd.it/b44c7eu136gf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=35c7f4ca87548d05d2ce287184774ba237721f49

So the White House finally released its long-promised crypto strategy paper. And while some were expecting big headlines (like a U.S. Bitcoin reserve or tokenized government assets), what we got instead was… policy.

Here’s a quick summary of what’s actually in the report:

🔍 **Key Points:**

* **CFTC** will be granted authority over spot crypto markets
* **Stablecoin licensing** will be streamlined and accelerated
* **Regulatory sandboxes** will be expanded for developers and startups
* **CBDC is officially ruled out** — the U.S. will *not* issue a digital dollar
* No mention of any government crypto holdings (BTC, ETH, SHIB, or otherwise)

📉 **What it means:**

There’s no market-moving announcement — no surprise buying, no SHIB-on-the-balance-sheet moment.

But this is the kind of structural clarity that markets have been waiting for.  
If the U.S. follows through, we’re looking at a cleaner, more predictable environment for DeFi protocols, stablecoin issuers, and **centralized exchanges** — many of which are already adapting.

**Coinbase** has pushed heavily for regulatory engagement. **OKX** has been proactive with transparency reports and licensing updates. And **WhiteBIT** has recently expanded its integrations with on-chain assets through campaign-based engagement — especially in DeFi-friendly regions.

Some CEXs are clearly preparing for a world where **compliance is infrastructure**, not a burden. The line between CeFi and DeFi is thinning — and those who bridge it early may benefit most.

2025-07-31,How has Crypto changed since 2020?,"I got it to Crypto for a year or so back in 2019/2020 I made somw money with Shib and Eth. 

I got really lucky and got into a popular NFT and sold it and made about 20k in a few weeks which was amazing. 

I bought into Polkadot and Saitama when they were pretty new and then I got out after losing money on a couple other random crypto projects that were all the rage for about 15 minutes. I remember DOGE was gonna moon ""Any day now $1 is just weeks away.""

I want to get back in but I'm not sure where to start. NFTs, where I made the most money, and had the most fun seem all but dead. The one I sold for $19k is now for sale for like $20 which is just crazy.

So what are people doing in Crypto in 2025? 
Where should I start? Just bitcoin or are people still making money on meme coins? I found it a lot of fun trying to find the next big thing but they all seem to have to turned to nothing, Polkadot seemed the most promising and exciting project back then. 

 I looked at the new top performers and I dont recognize any of them lol.

2025-07-31,Bitcoin's True Potential: Are We Still Underestimating It?,"Over the past years, Bitcoin has consistently defied expectations and exceeded even the most optimistic  ATH projections. What once seemed implausible has become reality time and again, as BTC has demonstrated remarkable resilience, adoption, and market momentum.

Given this trajectory, the idea of Bitcoin reaching $1 million no longer feels like a wild fantasy, it’s increasingly viewed as a long-term possibility by some investors and analysts. However, the more provocative question is: could it go even higher? Could we one day see BTC at $5 million, or even $10 million?

Of course, such valuations would imply an astronomical market capitalization—well into the hundreds of trillions of dollars. Achieving that would require not only widespread global adoption, but a significant reconfiguration of the global financial system, with Bitcoin possibly absorbing functions of store of value, reserve asset, and even partial medium of exchange on a global scale.

While such outcomes may seem far-fetched today, it’s worth noting that Bitcoin has surprised us repeatedly in the past. From being dismissed as an experiment, to surpassing gold in performance, to being held by institutional investors and nation-states, BTC’s history is defined by breaking boundaries that once seemed immovable. The question, then, may not be whether it can reach these prices—but under what conditions such a shift could happen.

So what do you think? Is $1M just the beginning, or are we reaching the ceiling? Let’s discuss.",0.9596

2025-07-31,"If DeFi is the future, why do so many Bitcoin believers reject Ethereum and other altcoins?","Decentralization has always been a central promise of the crypto world. The idea of removing intermediaries, building open financial systems, and empowering individuals is what drew many into Bitcoin in the first place.

But today, much of that decentralized functionality,ike lending, trading, stablecoins, and DAOs, is being developed primarily on Ethereum and other smart contract platforms. These ecosystems are creating real use cases that go beyond just storing value. They are expanding what crypto can do.

And yet, a significant portion of the Bitcoin community rejects these developments. Many BTC holders dismiss Ethereum and most altcoins as too centralized, too risky, or simply unnecessary. Their belief is that Bitcoin, as the most secure and decentralized asset, is all that truly matters.

This raises an important question: if people truly believe in the power of decentralization, why oppose the platforms that are actually building decentralized applications? Could it be that Ethereum and altcoins represent the next evolution of crypto, one that goes beyond just being digital gold?

What do you think? Is Bitcoin’s minimalist approach the way forward, or is the future of crypto being built in the DeFi space? Let’s talk.",0.9738

Satirical comedy, George Carlin style: https://cicero.sh/r/hows-the-ai-revolution

Dev branch: https://github.com/cicero-ai/cicero/tree/dev-master

Looking for a business partner / investor.  I'm tired of treading water by myself, and searching for tangible support now.  In exchange, I'll make you rich.

Need at least 1 and perferably 2 BTC to take care of everything necessary.  For collateral, you can have Apex at https://apexpl.io/.  Took me years to develop, intended to be a modern replacement to Wordpress, but unfortunately never gained any traction.  Beautiful software though, and I'll stand behind the quality of the engineering.  

If you're technical, just give the 4 line install that's on the home page a try and you'll see for yourself, it's really nice software.  You can have the domain name, Github repos (https://github.com/apexpl/), plus I'll transfer the website and entire network of SVN repos over to a server of your choice.  There's even a bitcoin web wallet package there, plus a bitcoin mixer package.

Probably shouldn't say this, but for background on me, Google ""jesse james british columbia murder"".  Don't worry about the Nazi stuff, as I can assure you it's simply not true.

I was his tech lead for 9 years.  With the current price of BTC, he probably has over $3 billion locked on the blockchain by now, much of which I was an integral part in helping him make.  I can do the same for you.

I have a break through in NLP coming in as soon as two weeks if I wish.  You can see the existing version of the NLU engine at: https://cicero.sh/sophia/

New POS tagger is already done, although not published.  47k custom, hybrid and fine tuned logistic regression models, one per ambiguous word, work a charm.  Far better than the existing PyTorch based POS taggers out there.

From my calculations, next version of NLU engine should bring in about $3000/day in API calls, plus about $200k/month in enterprise sales.  This is supposedly the era of AI agents, except they simply don't work.  My NLU engine is deterministic, hence you can rely on it, and it will actually just work unlike the existing crap that's out there.

I can complete the manifesto with quality, we're about 6 weeks out from a general release if I really wanted.  Help me help the world.  Help me transform the internet for the better.  

I have the necessary skills and experience to do it, but I'm tired of yelling into the void.  Support me, and I'll make you filthy rich.

Terms are at your desire.  If you want a loan with good interest, investment with monthly dividends, equity, whatever suits you.  I plan to incorporate in Singapore in the near future, so can issue you shares then.

Contact me anytime personally via e-mail at matt@cicero.sh.  Every last detail is technically mapped out in my mind, I just need to execute.  More than happy to provide my WhatsApp and answer any questions you may have.

Can anyone who has done it in Binance tell me the proper way to do it? No DMs ;).

Exodus allows to do swaps into the wallet itself to USDC and I don't know if it is better to convert all into btc there and then move it to Binance or do what swaps one by one. Since I will have to declare capital gains in my next tax report, I am trying to do it in the best possible way.

2025-08-05,"Bitcoin weekly market update, 4 August 2025","**Bitcoin pulled back, but closed the week well above its recent breakout level. Conservative price target still at $142k.**

In tradfi, last week stock markets had a good start of the week. Then came Wednesday, and the US Fed announced that there would be no July rate cut. This was no surprise at all, and the markets didn’t react much. What they did react to was the following press conference, where chairman Powell refused to give any promises of a September cut. This should have come as no surprise either, as Powell has repeated over and over and again and again that they will always follow the data. But still, the markets were apparently somewhat disappointed, and sold off a little.

However, the bigger sell off came on Thursday and Friday, as Trump announced a new barrage of tariffs that got everybody spooked, and as job number revisions came in much larger than expected. If we take a step back and look at the bigger picture though, so far this pull back is not large, and it could well turn into a normal correction in a strong uptrend.

Turning to bitcoin, despite following the rest of the market down, it closed the week at $114k, still sitting well above the breakout point at $109k. The breakout has not been invalidated, and the conservative price target remains at $142k. So with that in mind, it’s much too early to call any tops.

Let’s see what the stock markets do this week in response to last week’s news about tariffs and jobs. But for now, a mindset of patience and buy-the-dip seems the most rational.

We've [posted here before](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1l8q2ha/every_ai_model_including_o3_pro_veo_3_through/) - TL;DR we provide access to every AI model (text, image, video), fully privately, no subscription, pay only for what you use.

At this point I'm pretty sure we're in the top 10 of merchants doing most crypto payments with >5000 transactions last month alone. Try us out for free by replying here (I'll send you an invite), or just [visit the website](https://nano-gpt.com/) and deposit as little as $0.10.

## July Payment Statistics

We added a few coins this month, so the statistics are getting ever broader and ever more representative.

## 1. Monero

We have to start with **Monero**.

It's eating up everything else in our pie chart. XMR now sees 3x as much usage as 2nd place Nano, and is used more than all other coins combined at 52.91%.

Genuine props to the Monero community - offer a privacy solution and they will come!

## 2. Nano

Second biggest is once again **Nano**. Our love, our initial coin, and a coin that is punching way above its weight.

Ranked #400 in market cap, yet for months it's been the most used or 2nd most used coin on our platform at 17.71%.

It's also being integrated into BTCPayServer right now, so hopefully more merchants will accept it soon.

# 3. Bitcoin reclaims third

3rd biggest has been retaken by Bitcoin! 10.2% of payments were using Bitcoin, in addition to another 0.95% using the Lightning network.

Average BTC transaction size was $24.48, while Lightning's was $4.42. As expected, but still fun to confirm.

# 4. Litecoin

Digital silver **Litecoin** plus the recently added Litecoin MWEB added up to 6.7%.

6.59% Litecoin, 0.11% specifically MWEB.

To be fair - we only added MWEB payments about 7 days ago! Read the blog for more on our MWEB integration.

# Honorable mention: Zcash

Finally with a remarkable amount of usage, **Zcash** with 3.44%.

# Kaspa, MultiversX, Dash, Bitcoin Cash

Unfortunately as you can see Kaspa was barely used, with just 0.05% of usage.

We know there are a lot of Kaspa enthusiasts and presumably users as well - we'd love to get in touch with some Kaspa people to hear how we can let Kaspians know we exist!

Another addition this month that didn't pan out (so far) was MultiversX, with just 0.01% of total usage.

We know that there is a large community and that there is a lot of usage, so if anyone in MultiversX can get us on a podcast to explain NanoGPT, we're all ears!

In a similar vein the typical payment coins like Bitcoin Cash and Dash do not see the amount of usage on NanoGPT that you would expect. We clearly need to up our outreach there!

That's all for now - any questions we are of course happy to answer. And if you want to also read about some NanoGPT updates, read the comment below.",0.9945
2025-08-05,"Lost $13,791 due to Backpack outage – sharing my experience","Hey everyone. Just wanted to share what happened to me during the recent Backpack Exchange outage in July. I had open ETH and BTC perp positions and was up around $6K unrealized profit at the time. The platform suddenly went down, and I was completely locked out. I have timestamped screenshots and even support chat logs showing I tried to act.

By the time I got access again, the platform was still glitchy, and I eventually got liquidated. Total loss: around $13,791 including initial margin. I’ve been going back and forth with support, but their current reimbursement policy doesn’t seem to cover situations like mine, even though the issue was clearly platform-side.

I’m sharing this not to stir anything up, but because I think it’s important users know how things were handled. I still hope they do the right thing.

This wouldn’t be for daily spending, just for savings or emergency funds. Where I live, holding fiat means constantly losing value due to inflation and a weakening local currency. I’m not really looking to earn interest or yield on it, I already hold BTC for that, i want to keep money pegged to usd. I just want a more stable way to preserve value, but also stay on self custody. USDC seems like an option, but I know it comes with risks. What are the pros and cons, risks?

2025-08-06,Reducing withdrawal fees from Binance to Trezor cold wallet,"Hello, I have some Bitcoin left in my Binance account, and I would like to transfer it to my Trezor wallet.  
Since Binance charges a fixed withdrawal fee of 0.001 BTC when using the BTC (SegWit) network, I’m looking to avoid paying nearly $200 in fees, if it's a test transaction and a subsequent full transfer.

I also have a Kraken account, but they only provide P2SH (3...) or native SegWit (bc1...) deposit addresses. Binance doesn’t allow withdrawals to 3... addresses over the ""Bitcoin"" network, so using Kraken would still be the same 0.001 BTC fee via SegWit.

As an alternative, I thought about transferring the BTC from Binance via Lightning Network to a Phoenix Wallet, which supports both Lightning and on-chain Bitcoin. From there, I plan to send the coins on-chain to my Trezor wallet.

Is this the best approach for minimizing fees while securely transferring BTC to cold storage?",0.9343
2025-08-06,Decibel launches on Aptos: The unified onchain exchange layer now live on devnet,"Aptos just saw the launch of Decibel, a new onchain trading protocol developed by Decibel Foundation and Aptos Labs. The main goal is to address the fragmented state of DeFi trading by combining spot, perps, margin, and vaults into a single, fully programmable platform: all onchain, built natively for Aptos’ high-speed architecture.

Some key details:

• Decibel acts as a full-stack exchange engine. It lets users trade spot and perpetuals from a single multicollateral account (supports APT, USDC, BTC, ETH, SOL, and others).

• Every trade, match, and cancel happens onchain, nothing is routed offchain.

• Liquidity is unified across products. Protocol vaults and user-managed vaults can both contribute to market-making.

• Supports direct onboarding from other chains and CEXs, with no new seed phrases needed.

• The underlying Aptos blockchain is designed for high throughput and fast block times (currently 120ms, aiming for sub-20ms), which enables CEX-like performance.

Aptos DeFi has been growing steadily this year, hitting over $1B TVL and significant stablecoin inflows (see Messari’s H1 2025 Aptos report for data). Decibel aims to turn what’s currently a patchwork of separate protocols into a more unified and composable experience, both for users and developers.

2025-08-07,I’m probably going to stop manual DCA… but I need your input first,"DCA is probably one of the best long-term strategies in crypto. 

1. No need to time the market. 
2. Reduces emotional decisions 
3. Less stress 
4. Better average over time 
5. And above all, it helps you accumulate consistently without overthinking.

But… theory and reality don’t always line up.

I’ve been doing manual DCA for about a year, trying to buy a bit of BTC and ETH every week. But here’s the problem:

* I often forget.
* I get influenced by price swings.
* I FOMO into pumps or freeze during dips.
* And honestly, I’m getting mentally tired.

I still believe in BTC. I’m here for the long run. But truthfully, I’m thinking of stopping manual DCA.  
I might just calculate my average, take a break, and see where we’re at a few years from now.

But before that…

 What tools or platforms do you use to automate your DCA?  
I’d love to keep it going without having to think about it every week.

I’ve already done some research and didn’t find much **except for “Start a Recurring Buy”**, a Bitget event that lets you automate DCA (with a bonus), but it’s ending soon.  
That convinced me tools like this must exist. I just need something that’ll last long-term.

But lately, something has changed. Maybe it’s just experience, or maybe am finally tired of watching my emotions yo-yo with every green or red candle. I am starting to care less about the day to day noise and more about slow, steady growth.

Like, instead of trying to catch every pump, I have been more focused on consistently building my portfolio, mostly BTC and ETH, with the occasional side bet on something interesting. Not huge trades, just regular, boring discipline and honestly, it feels peaceful. 

I still follow news, trends, and new projects, but am not jumping in and out like before. I haveeven skipped a few hype cycles on purpose, just to see how it feels to not FOMO.

2025-08-07,"Vitalik Buterin: ""The next goal we should shoot for is, in my view, fast (<1h) withdrawal times, enabled by validity (aka ZK) proof systems.""","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasizes the importance of reducing liquidity withdrawal times under 1 hour, considering it more urgent than achieving ""Stage 2"" L2 decentralization.  


He suggests moving from optimistic to validity (ZK) proof systems, citing improved technology and resources like ethproofs.org. Buterin proposes a hybrid proof system and long-term goals for 12-second settlement times, aiming to make Ethereum L1 a high-speed settlement hub across the L2 ecosystem.

This could also drive staking numbers because people wouldn't have to feel they're losing access to their ETH for X days.



**TL;DR:**

* Vitalik Buterin says sub-one-hour withdrawal time is now more urgent than stage 2 L2 decentralization.
* Slow withdrawals push users toward risky bridging solutions, undermining Ethereum’s trustless design.
* The medium goal is 12-second, near-instant cross-rollup settlements anchored by Ethereum L1.",0.647

I want to share something bullish about ADA. This chart shows cardano when measured in XRP. Cardano has lost 93% of its value relative to XRP since early 2021 as 1 ADA is now equal to less than 0.25 XRP. This isn't a shitpost on ADA. It's bullish because it means ADA is undervalued relative to XRP. Years of underperformance now the create the conditions for a reversal on this chart. I do expect ADA to outperform XRP going forward. The charts is also at a multi-year support level of 0.25 XRP. We have seen big bounces from this level in the past and I expect to see it again as ADA approaches $5+

Some might say this chart has no significance. But I disagree. Remember when everyone on this sub was mega bearish on ETH back in April....well we saw eth/btc hit key support levels and now a rapid v-shape recovery. This wasn't a coincidence:

That seems like a major increase and hard to justify it happening again, but markets come in waves and things can happen quick when there’s momentum behind it. Can you foresee a quick move to 6t later this year? If BTC took only 1/4 of that piece, it would reach a 3t market cap and 50% dominance. I could see ETH grabbing 1/2 of that 2t TMC increase. That would bring ETH up to a 1.5t market cap and reach 20-25% dominance again, which seems on the table given recent institutional support. Maybe 6t is actually low and we see 8t later this year or into next year.

\- ETH season is done and we have a situation where money flows from ETH into major alts (top 10-20 by market cap). There will be several cycles not all alts pump at the same time and some alts will have more than 1 pump.

\- Alt season is not starting yet just the top ones are pumping

\- Finally once every dead coin and every meme and everything left and right starts to pump we call that an altcoin season. Your granny, your boss and co workers, your uber driver and basically everyone talks about them bitcorns.

The latter is the top indicator and you should move your money into BTC again. The alt season typically lasts for about 1-2 months so if you don't time it right and are stubborn you'll go all the way down to 90-95% from this cycle ATH (that's basically 99% of you in this sub) when the bear bottom hits you in the face.

You also don't keep all of your converted BTC when the bear starts, you either sell 50% for FIAT (if you need to buy something in the real world like a lambo or a new wife) or stablecoins. You can park your stablecoins on lending and borrowing platforms and get 30% APY while your fiat gets you close to zero APY when you move it to your bankster's place.

Once the bear is at its peak you use that fiat/stablecoin to buy BTC again because nobody is buying BTC at ATL except the smart asses like you positioning themselves for the next bull run for that 10x cheese.

Repeat this every cycle, and you're set for life and of course never sell everything in one go during the bull cause nobody can time the top but sell 10%, then 25%, then 40% (close to the global top hopefully) and then the rest -> 25%.

2025-08-11,What would happen,"Hello, this is a legitimate question for the community, so here it is. If the majority of money that has been dumped into bit coin is USD, I'm just going to make up a number 70 percent (tried to research the actual number but couldnt find any data). 

Now let's say the US dollar collapses because they can no longer service their national debt.  Let's say the US dollar is worth 1/10th of what it usually is. 

Would this also drop bitcoin by almost the same amount considering how much investment was made originally in USD? Or does bitcoin price stay the same because once the coin is bought it doesnt have a direct relationship to the currency it was purchased with?

On one hand it could be treated as it's own commodity and could retain its value on the world market, it would just cost 10 times more USD to buy a coin. 

But on the other hand if people started cashing out their bitcoin into USD theoretically the ""stockpile"" of USD that went into it wouldnt be enough to service all the people who wanted to cash out.

Would love to hear peoples insight on what they believe would happen, or maybe you actually know how it all works and there is a finite answer.

Completely arbitrary. Substantially pointless, given the technological and financial sophistication of most of their marketplace. I asked for an exception, and they denied it. I asked whether there was a person I could appeal this decision to, and got this:



""I understand your frustration. However, the $5,000 daily crypto withdrawal limit is a system-wide policy and cannot be appealed or manually adjusted by Robinhood support or management. This limit is determined automatically based on account activity and verification, and there is no process to request an exception or appeal. You can continue transferring up to your daily limit until your full balance is moved. If you have questions about how to transfer or need help with the process, I’m here to assist.""

  
So if you're stacking at Robinhood, and you're considering moving your crypto to self-custody (or anywhere!), be careful. You could be looking at months of daily transfers ahead of you if/when you shift.

Everyone in crypto has heard about Bitcoin Pizza Day, but when you really think about it, it’s insane. Back in May 2010, a Florida programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz offered 10,000 BTC to anyone who’d send him two pizzas. Some guy took him up on it and ordered Papa John’s to his door. At the time, those coins were worth about $41. Today? Around $1 billion. It was the first documented instance of Bitcoin being used for a real-world purchase. That single transaction showed BTC could actually be *spent*. Without Laszlo’s appetite, Bitcoin’s adoption story might have looked very different.

  
2. The One-Cent Bitcoin (2011)

Fast forward a year, and Bitcoin had found its first major villain: Mt. Gox. In June 2011, hackers breached the exchange and managed to tank Bitcoin’s price from around $17 to $0.01 in minutes.  
It was a “flash crash” before the term was even popular in crypto. The price bounced back quickly, but the incident showed just how fragile and unregulated things were back then. A single exchange mishap could swing the entire market. Imagine something like that happening today...

  
3. $600 Million Buried in a Landfill (2013 – Present)

This one hurts the most. In 2013, a Welsh IT worker named James Howells accidentally threw away a hard drive containing private keys to 8,000 BTC. That drive ended up in a massive landfill in Newport, South Wales. He’s been trying to get permission to dig it up for over a decade by offering millions to the local council if they’d let him search. They always refused, citing environmental concerns. As of this year, he’s officially given up. The landfill is now basically a Bitcoin graveyard worth over $600 million at current prices. Every time I lose a USB stick, I think about this guy and suddenly feel better.

  
4. The $14.5 Billion Heist Nobody Noticed (2020 – 2025)

The largest crypto theft ever didn’t come from an exchange collapse, it came from a quiet breach of a Chinese mining pool called LuBian. In December 2020, thieves stole 127,000 BTC, worth $14.5 billion today. The insane part is that it went completely undetected for five years until it was finally traced in 2025.

5. The Quadriga Mystery (2019)

Canada’s biggest crypto exchange, QuadrigaCX, collapsed after its CEO, Gerald Cotten, died in India, taking the only passwords to the exchange’s cold wallets with him. Over $190 million in crypto vanished.  
Some still believe he faked his death and Netflix even made a documentary about it.

  
**TL;DR:** 

Bitcoin’s early years were absolute chaos, ranging from billion dollar pizzas, flash crashes to $0.01, millions buried in a landfill, a $14.5B theft that went unnoticed for 5 years and a mysterious CEO death locking away $190M. The history is as wild as the price swings.",-0.9936
2025-08-12,US Might “Print” $900B Without Selling a Single Ounce of Gold – And BTC Could Be the Biggest Winner,"Global finance is getting shaky again. Traditional tools are losing their punch, and now the US is openly talking about a move straight out of the history books — **gold monetization**.

Here’s the play:

* The US holds **261.5M ounces of gold**, officially valued at $42/oz (1973 prices 🤯).
* Market price today: **$3,300+/oz**.
* If revalued, Treasury could issue gold certificates at the new price to the Fed, instantly crediting **\~$900B** without selling a single bar.
* No new debt, just… magic money backed by gold.

It’s been done before:

* **1933:** FDR confiscated gold, raised price by 69%, pumped cash into the economy.
* **1971–73:** Nixon ended gold-dollar convertibility, Treasury revalued, pocketed \~$800M without selling gold.

Why now?

* Fed’s own memo (Aug 1) points to other countries doing it — Germany, Italy, Lebanon, South Africa.
* Analysts like Luke Gromen say revaluing to **$20K/oz** could free up **$5T**, slashing US debt-to-GDP from 122% → \~70%.
* Trump’s Treasury officials are hinting it’s “on the table.”

The crypto twist:

* Last year, Sen. Cynthia Lummis floated using revalued gold profits to **buy Bitcoin** for a US strategic reserve — “budget-neutral.”
* Trump’s crypto advisor called it “the best way” to get BTC without taxing Americans.

Why this matters for Bitcoin:

1. If fiat confidence drops, capital looks for hard assets — gold *and* BTC.
2. State-level BTC accumulation could push it into a **reserve asset class**.
3. But… big players = big control risks: more regulation, less freedom, political capture.

Bottom line:  
Gold monetization might be sold as a “smart debt fix,” but it’s still stealth money printing. If it happens, we could see:

* **Short-term:** BTC moon fuel 🚀
* **Long-term:** A fight for BTC’s soul — decentralized freedom vs. state-controlled asset.",0.9477

2025-08-12,Stop the government taking a cut,"If you actually believe in free markets, Monero isn’t optional, it’s a tool.

Everyone loves to talk about “financial freedom” and “free markets” but most of you are still sitting with coins on exchanges, doing your taxes and trusting the same government you say you hate.

If you believe in free markets for everything, including drugs, privacy, and keeping your own profits, Monero is how you actually do it.

So you bought bitcoin for 50 bucks, it’s now worth 2 grand, and the government wants 500 of it. They took zero risk in that trade. When banks or corporations screw up, they get bailouts paid for by our taxes. When you win, they take a cut. When you lose, they vanish.

Monero fixes that. Nobody knows your 50 bucks of BTC turned into 2k if you swap through Monero. No blockchain trail, no reporting, no “oops, I forgot to declare my gains” with your name all over a public ledger.

And for those who support drug legalization… you can talk all day about how the war on drugs is bad and how the free market should decide, but if you aren’t using the tech that actually makes that possible right now, you’re just talking. Monero enables that market today.

When talking about tax avoidance and drugs, most Monero users see it as a flaw and try to hide it. They'll say “oh it’s only a small percent of the volume” or “fiat is worse.” Screw that. The answer should be “fuck yes it’s used for this, that’s the point” and “fuck taxes, fuck government overreach” and “what does your shitcoin do for the average person?”

We took the risk with crypto, it could have gone to zero. The government didn’t take the risk, so they don’t deserve a reward. They’ll never bail us out, so why are we letting them cash in when we win?",0.4234
2025-08-12,"Bitcoin weekly market update, 11 August 2025","**Bitcoin bounced, then closed the week right below short term weekly resistance. Conservative price target of $142k remains.**

Last week, as markets were down across the board after the tariff and job number scares, we had this to say about BTC:

*The breakout has not been invalidated, and the price target remains at $142k. So with that in mind, it’s much too early to call any tops.*

*Let’s see what the stock markets do this week in response to last week’s tariff news. But for now, a mindset of patience and buy-the-dip seems the most rational.*

And well, that did indeed turn out to be the right call. Stocks bounced back. Bitcoin bounced back.

There is some US inflation data coming in this week, so we’ll keep an eye on that. But for now, there is still nothing bearish about the weekly bitcoin chart, and the most likely path is up from here.

2025-08-12,Monero and the scenarios around a possible 51% attack,"If you have been in crypto for a while, you know the term “51% attack” is not just theory in a textbook. It is a scenario that can completely destroy confidence in a network. Right now there is information going around that Monero might be in the middle of a successful one, carried out by Qubic, a mining pool that has allegedly been building up massive hashrate over the past months. 

  
Firstly, from a technical point of view, if a single actor controls the majority of the mining power, they can reorganize the blockchain at will. That means reversing transactions, performing double spends, and even censoring addresses entirely. For Monero, a coin built on the idea of censorship resistance and complete privacy, this situation strikes at the very core of its purpose.

  
Now think about the economic effects. Estimates say such an attack costs around seventy five million dollars per day. That is a huge sum, but if the motive is political or strategic, cost might not be the barrier. So far XMR is down roughly thirteen percent, which is surprisingly small given the severity of the claim. If this news becomes fully confirmed across the market, the drop could be much sharper, especially if major exchanges suspend deposits and withdrawals.

  
Let’s go through some possible scenarios. In the optimistic one, the Monero team and community act fast with a hard fork to change the consensus algorithm, removing the attacker’s advantage. That could restore trust, but it risks splitting the community and harming liquidity. In a negative one, Qubic maintains control for weeks, effectively centralizing the entire network and destroying Monero’s credibility as a private currency. Another option is that large miners cooperate temporarily to dilute the attacker’s hashrate, but that raises questions about centralization. And of course there is the possibility that this attack is backed by a state actor who wants to eliminate a project they cannot control.

  
The impact would not stop at Monero. If such an attack succeeds and is sustained, it could damage confidence in all privacy coins. Investors might move toward alternatives like Zcash, Firo, or privacy layers built on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Regulators could also use this as a case study to push for outright bans on privacy focused projects, arguing that they are security risks.

  
If you are following this in the coming days, pay attention to a few things. Watch for official statements from Monero developers and the core community. Keep an eye on mining pool hashrate distribution to see if Qubic’s dominance is as big as claimed. Track how major exchanges respond and whether they freeze XMR transactions. And of course, watch the market reaction in terms of volume and price stability.

  
**TLDR:**

Monero might be under a successful 51% attack by Qubic, giving them power to reverse transactions, double spend, and censor addresses. If sustained, it could destroy trust in XMR and hurt all privacy coins. Possible outcomes include an emergency hard fork, extended centralization, or coordinated miner defense. Watch dev statements, hashrate stats, and exchange responses in the coming days.",-0.901
2025-08-12,New Crypto Dashboard app I made,"Hi all, just working on a side project [https://www.crypto-scanning.com/](https://www.crypto-scanning.com/) and would like some feedback (working on the color scheme of the side bar and overlapping text on the chart) on what other things to implement.

This app allows you to enter your crypto holdings such as say 10 ETH and compare what your holdings are worth against another coins market cap. So you can see what value your 10ETH would be if you wanted to say ""what if ETH hits 50% of the market cap of BTC""
