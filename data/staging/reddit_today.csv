2025-05-31,L2 are getting high beta exposure,"All the L2s are getting anally railed as ethereum and the big dawg is experiencing a small decline.

Just a few days ago ARB(the biggest L2 other than BASE) was at 0.44 but it experienced 10 straight consecutive 4h bars of red. That has never happened before in the history of ARBs listing. It feels like people are indeed focusing on only BTC and ETH, and not allocating funds to anything else.

ETH was at 1400 a month ago, so the fact that it is at 2500 now, even if its significantly below the ATH, its still doing marginally well. L2s and other alts however have fallen back to the levels when ETH's price was 1400, giving back most of the gains.

Now I'm staring at some potential liquidations straight in the face, I just want to let all other people out the experiencing the same feelings to understand that u are not alone. And if shit goes tit's up, just take it as a lesson and move on.

Markets are fucked. Orange man tarriff ping pong game is still in play, let's all just go touch some grass and let it play out. No more adding positions, no more doubling down, no more looking at charts for 48 hours.

See u on the other side kings and Queens.",-0.2323
