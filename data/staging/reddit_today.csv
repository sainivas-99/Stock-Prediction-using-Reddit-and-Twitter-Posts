2025-08-12,US Might ‚ÄúPrint‚Äù $900B Without Selling a Single Ounce of Gold ‚Äì And BTC Could Be the Biggest Winner,"Global finance is getting shaky again. Traditional tools are losing their punch, and now the US is openly talking about a move straight out of the history books ‚Äî **gold monetization**.

Here‚Äôs the play:

* The US holds **261.5M ounces of gold**, officially valued at $42/oz (1973 prices ü§Ø).
* Market price today: **$3,300+/oz**.
* If revalued, Treasury could issue gold certificates at the new price to the Fed, instantly crediting **\~$900B** without selling a single bar.
* No new debt, just‚Ä¶ magic money backed by gold.

It‚Äôs been done before:

* **1933:** FDR confiscated gold, raised price by 69%, pumped cash into the economy.
* **1971‚Äì73:** Nixon ended gold-dollar convertibility, Treasury revalued, pocketed \~$800M without selling gold.

Why now?

* Fed‚Äôs own memo (Aug 1) points to other countries doing it ‚Äî Germany, Italy, Lebanon, South Africa.
* Analysts like Luke Gromen say revaluing to **$20K/oz** could free up **$5T**, slashing US debt-to-GDP from 122% ‚Üí \~70%.
* Trump‚Äôs Treasury officials are hinting it‚Äôs ‚Äúon the table.‚Äù

The crypto twist:

* Last year, Sen. Cynthia Lummis floated using revalued gold profits to **buy Bitcoin** for a US strategic reserve ‚Äî ‚Äúbudget-neutral.‚Äù
* Trump‚Äôs crypto advisor called it ‚Äúthe best way‚Äù to get BTC without taxing Americans.

Why this matters for Bitcoin:

1. If fiat confidence drops, capital looks for hard assets ‚Äî gold *and* BTC.
2. State-level BTC accumulation could push it into a **reserve asset class**.
3. But‚Ä¶ big players = big control risks: more regulation, less freedom, political capture.

Bottom line:  
Gold monetization might be sold as a ‚Äúsmart debt fix,‚Äù but it‚Äôs still stealth money printing. If it happens, we could see:

* **Short-term:** BTC moon fuel üöÄ
* **Long-term:** A fight for BTC‚Äôs soul ‚Äî decentralized freedom vs. state-controlled asset.",0.9477

2025-08-12,Stop the government taking a cut,"If you actually believe in free markets, Monero isn‚Äôt optional, it‚Äôs a tool.

Everyone loves to talk about ‚Äúfinancial freedom‚Äù and ‚Äúfree markets‚Äù but most of you are still sitting with coins on exchanges, doing your taxes and trusting the same government you say you hate.

If you believe in free markets for everything, including drugs, privacy, and keeping your own profits, Monero is how you actually do it.

So you bought bitcoin for 50 bucks, it‚Äôs now worth 2 grand, and the government wants 500 of it. They took zero risk in that trade. When banks or corporations screw up, they get bailouts paid for by our taxes. When you win, they take a cut. When you lose, they vanish.

Monero fixes that. Nobody knows your 50 bucks of BTC turned into 2k if you swap through Monero. No blockchain trail, no reporting, no ‚Äúoops, I forgot to declare my gains‚Äù with your name all over a public ledger.

And for those who support drug legalization‚Ä¶ you can talk all day about how the war on drugs is bad and how the free market should decide, but if you aren‚Äôt using the tech that actually makes that possible right now, you‚Äôre just talking. Monero enables that market today.

When talking about tax avoidance and drugs, most Monero users see it as a flaw and try to hide it. They'll say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs only a small percent of the volume‚Äù or ‚Äúfiat is worse.‚Äù Screw that. The answer should be ‚Äúfuck yes it‚Äôs used for this, that‚Äôs the point‚Äù and ‚Äúfuck taxes, fuck government overreach‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat does your shitcoin do for the average person?‚Äù

We took the risk with crypto, it could have gone to zero. The government didn‚Äôt take the risk, so they don‚Äôt deserve a reward. They‚Äôll never bail us out, so why are we letting them cash in when we win?",0.4234

2025-08-12,"Bitcoin weekly market update, 11 August 2025","**Bitcoin bounced, then closed the week right below short term weekly resistance. Conservative price target of $142k remains.**

Last week, as markets were down across the board after the tariff and job number scares, we had this to say about BTC:

*The breakout has not been invalidated, and the price target remains at $142k. So with that in mind, it‚Äôs much too early to call any tops.*

*Let‚Äôs see what the stock markets do this week in response to last week‚Äôs tariff news. But for now, a mindset of patience and buy-the-dip seems the most rational.*

And well, that did indeed turn out to be the right call. Stocks bounced back. Bitcoin bounced back.

There is some US inflation data coming in this week, so we‚Äôll keep an eye on that. But for now, there is still nothing bearish about the weekly bitcoin chart, and the most likely path is up from here.

2025-08-12,New Crypto Dashboard app I made,"Hi all, just working on a side project [https://www.crypto-scanning.com/](https://www.crypto-scanning.com/) and would like some feedback (working on the color scheme of the side bar and overlapping text on the chart) on what other things to implement.

This app allows you to enter your crypto holdings such as say 10 ETH and compare what your holdings are worth against another coins market cap. So you can see what value your 10ETH would be if you wanted to say ""what if ETH hits 50% of the market cap of BTC""

  
Taking all suggestions and feedback :) new dev will love for people to kind out bugs",0.9468
