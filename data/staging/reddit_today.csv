2025-06-15,Where are people buying BTC and transferring it to a wallet at a low cost?,"I have primarily bought altcoins the past 4 years but I want to start DCAing into BTC. I had started in 2021 but then stopped and Iâ€™m seeing thatâ€™s a mistake. 

What would people recommend to buy BTC for cheap transfer over to something like a ledger. I currently donâ€™t have ledger Iâ€™ve used cold wallets to hold my alts but I want a hard wallet for my BTC. Or do platforms like ledger let you buy BTC directly on their platform?

I could buy the spot ETF but I want control over my own stuff. I donâ€™t need blackrock using me to manipulate markets.

2025-06-16,"Right now, BTC is caught between FOMO and fear. The market is bullish â€” but the world isnâ€™t exactly stable.","On one hand, weâ€™ve got solid bullish signals:  
â€¢ SharpLink Gaming just bought $463 million worth of ETH, becoming the largest public ETH holder.  
â€¢ Anthony Pompliano is reportedly raising $750 million via a SPAC to buy Bitcoin. Yes, *that* Pompliano â€” the one who was calling for $500K BTC during the bear market.  
â€¢ BTC hit $110,000 last Tuesday â€” almost breaking its ATH of $111,940 from May 22.

â€” On the other hand, the macro picture isn't so pretty:  
â€¢ Israeli airstrikes on Iran sent BTC down 2.8% in 90 minutes. They can crash BTC at any moment, all it takes is another hit.  
â€¢ Last time, $427 million in long positions got wiped out. Bulls took a hit, fast.

# So, can BTC still reach $119,000 in this climate?

Personally, Iâ€™m cautiously optimistic.

âœ“ The fundamentals are strong: institutional adoption, post-halving supply tightening, growing ETF demand, and now SPACs targeting BTC.  
âœ— But short-term moves are still dictated by geopolitics. And thatâ€™s not something even the whales can control.

So yes, $119K is possible â€” but timing it depends more on global stability than TA.

# What about Ethereum?

ETH is quietly building up momentum too:  
â€¢ SharpLink staked over 95% of its ETH â€” thatâ€™s a long-term move, not just speculation.  
â€¢ If this continues, a return to $4,000 feels realistic. Not immediate, but definitely in sight â€” especially if the SEC eases up.

What do you think?  
â€¢ Can BTC still hit $119K this year?  
â€¢ Are we underestimating the impact of war and instability?  
â€¢ Should ETH be getting more attention right now?

2025-06-15,Some 'Alternative' info and thoughts about 'Alt'coins,"1. If BTC could absorb the marketcap of ALL the coins except for the top 10, it would increase... only 20%.  The idea that altcoins hurt BTC is likely false.  Competition is healthy- it means there is demand.  So we can relax, altcoins aren't ruining your investment.

2. There are not 17M + ""alt"" coins.  Those are mostly memecoins or very specific use case driven projects leveraging blockchain concepts.  

3. As noted in the first bullet, 80% of the value is still in the top 10.  After about the top 1000, the value isn't worth talking about.  

  
4. If we have decided BTC is the store of value, then it's fair to say many of the top 100 are more prepared to serve as a payment system, or deliver a business specific use case.  This means they aren't an alternative to BTC, and they aren't competing for the same marketshare.    
  
5. Smart contracts are an ""alternative"" concept- the added value to blockchain continues to evolve.  If this proves to be valuable enough within a store of value use case, then perhaps that is an ""altcoin"" directly competing with BTC.

6. ""Altseason"" 4 years ago mostly applied to ethereum and new coins.  Now we have a wide variety of alts in the top 1000, all in different stages earning marketshare.  Many top coins have higher marketcaps, so achieving 10x or more from those levels does seem challenging.  New coins face competition, and much greater scrutiny, so the percentage that breakout will not match the last cycle.

7. Higher Marketcaps? This doesn't mean they are sitting near all time highs - some are though!  It means many are sitting at higher lows than 4 years ago.  Btw, if you are achieving higher lows, that does not mean you are disappearing, that means you are growing.  A common talking point is these projects are disappearing, which simply is not true. 

8. Calling any alt a ""shitcoin"" is a pathetic attack which ignores the potential value of using the technology.  Just a reminder, they are building upon the same concepts BTC leverages.  More folks believing in blockchain tech strengthens the space, including BTC.  It would be good to see open discussion again about what is being achieved with the mindset that not everything is a threat to your investment.

In summary- while the narratives attack altcoins, they really aren't hurting BTC investments.  There is a variety of market opportunity that BTC is not suited for.  Investing in altcoins is more challenging than 4 years ago- choosing from old and new, big and small.  But it is healthy and positive for the space overall if investment continues.  ",0.977
2025-06-16,Bitcoin Buying Timing: War Fears and Market Recovery Analysis,"The market has been rattled once more by rising tensions between Iran and Israel. This news was enough to shake the entire asset market, including cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin briefly threatening the $100,000 mark and altcoins facing steep corrections. Itâ€™s a familiar sceneâ€”one of recurring fear and doubt. But what does it all truly mean?

Looking back, similar conflicts unfolded in April and October 2024. The market reacted with momentary panic and a surge in selling, only to recover swiftly within days. This time appears no different. **The fact that fear hasnâ€™t lingered long suggests this is less a structural collapse and more a technical reaction.** Itâ€™s a clue that thereâ€™s more to this than just a price dropâ€”something worth examining beneath the surface.

The Iran-Israel conflict has been limited to strategic airstrikes and restrained missile responses, without direct ground confrontation. This points to a localized skirmish rather than an all-out war, likely acting as an event that pauses the marketâ€™s existing rhythm rather than redefining its course. In other words, this uncertainty may fade within days rather than persist.

**This hints that, between collapse and counterattack, the latter is gaining traction**. Meanwhile, Ethereum is showing striking momentum, with trading volume and futures open interest hitting all-time highs, suggesting not just a technical bounce but a structural signal of institutional entry.

The ETH/BTC ratio further confirms Ethereumâ€™s relative strength, **shifting focus from short-term price swings to the potential for a broader transition.**

The altcoin market tells a bigger story. The OTHERS market cap chart shows it breaking out of a months-long downtrend, now digesting consolidation in the Phase D zone. If this level holds, a return to an upward cycle seems plausible.

**This isnâ€™t a mere bearish turn but a retest of the upper boundary of the prior downtrend channelâ€”a technical validation of support.**

The TOTAL3 index reinforces this, with the altcoin marketâ€™s cycle of surge, correction, support confirmation, and rebreakout still intact, currently poised for its next expansion.

Amid this, Coinbaseâ€™s inclusion in the S&P 500 marks a symbolic shift. Itâ€™s not just a stock updateâ€”itâ€™s a structural milestone for the cryptocurrency industry crossing into mainstream acceptance. Wall Street no longer sees digital assets as outliers but as candidates for integration. The door to institutionalization is opening.

Ripple, meanwhile, has been quietly consolidating in a box range for 195 days. This prolonged stagnation could precede an explosive breakout in either direction, with the 2.08 level acting as a key support that, if held, might serve as a buying point.

Ultimately, the market is swaying in uncertainty, but that uncertainty could fuel the next move. The pattern of war, fear, correction, and rebound has repeated through 2024 and now into June 2025. History suggests these dips often recover quickly, laying the groundwork for fresh rallies. Rather than being paralyzed by fear, it might be worth reading the structure of the flow and preparing for whatâ€™s next. Opportunities donâ€™t come often, but when they do, theyâ€™re brief and potent. This could be one of those moments.",-0.9705
