There is no second best,"Most people new to Crypto think about the fiat dollar equivalent value when they buy into their coin/token of choice. It has become clear that Bitcoin is the King and BTC.D shows the way to future high value. Ultimately, if gains is the goal, BTC at 1M is a 10x upside from here. Understanding the market moves is difficult but selecting a way to diversify your holdings is always important. Holding BTC for the long term is fool proof, always has been. Alts come and go. Considering mass adoption, BTC still leads the forefront of global usage. Outside of NFTs, what other networks have value like Bitcoin? Bitcoin is sound money but why has it succeeded when XMR, LTC, and BCH have stayed stagnant? Is there really a Silver to match Bitcoin's Gold? Are there hidden gems in the small cap alt space building something better? Why has the idea behind why Bitcoin was created to begin with so muddied? How many networks exist that respect user privacy, have public transparency, are easy and inexpensive to use, decentralized, and resistant to technology advancements? 

Is there really no other networks that are not created by a company or central authority? Chia (XCH) is a smart contract version of Bitcoin but at it core is CNI. BitcoinZ (BTCZ) is a Zk fork of Zcash without a central company driving it forward. It's community driven which is a weakness these days for lack of funds and consensus. Just like Bitcoin in the beginning, things were uncertain but steady work and communication allowed for stronger advancements. Is the crypto space really just boiling down to tokens and trash smart contracts? Is there hope for a new network that grants financial freedom to anyone?

"""Violent rejection at 107k""","￼​

I mentioned this in another thread and got downvoted — fair enough. But I still stand by what I saw, so here's the full thought:

BTC pumped hard despite bearish macro signals — including the S&P 500 closing red Friday, and the U.S. treasury getting downgraded over the weekend. Futures looked bad, Monday expected to open red, and we know BTC tends to follow equities. So why the hell did it pump?

In my opinion, this was a classic trap ; whales took advantage of low liquidity and retail FOMO to pump and dump. Once BTC hit resistance, it got violently rejected. This isn’t new, but it's frustrating how predictable it is sometimes.

What do you all think? Am I missing something macro here, or was this just manipulation 101?
