BTC pumps on 90-day tariff pause,"Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto market ramps up Wednesday afternoon while the Nasdaq index was nearing a 10% gain as the latest announcment from the White House calmed markets that had been rocked by fears of a prolonged and aggressive trade war.

In other words….
We will have to print more money to subsidize US industry.

[Metrics] BTC on Exchanges Drops to Lowest Level Since 2018 — What It Means,"

The percentage of BTC held on centralized exchanges has dropped to 7.53%, the lowest level since 2018.

This reflects a growing trend: investors are increasingly moving their BTC off exchanges and into self-custody — a strong signal of long-term conviction.

Less BTC on exchanges = less sell pressure.
When coins are moved to cold storage, they’re much harder to sell on the spot, reducing immediate supply and lowering the risk of sharp price drops.

This decline in exchange reserves also points to rising institutional interest and more secure long-term custody solutions. It’s becoming clear that more participants now treat BTC as a store of value, not just a speculative asset.

Historically, such trends have aligned with bullish market phases.

How can anyone justify this? Crypto.com user loses 13% of their funds to sell their crypto. Their position was up 15% and considering the buy fee they probably lost 20% in fees overall - which makes their +15% profit on the trade a net loss.,"What you are seeing is Crypto.com's way of robbing their users through spread. They mass market and direct crypto noobs to the crypto.com app where they scam users with insane fees. Historically around 15% for a full trade but this full trade would be closer to 20% in fees.  
  
When you buy on the app crypto.com sells you crypto for way above above market price, and when you sell on the app crypto.com sells your crypto for way below market price, robbing you of your funds in both directions. In this case this user was up 15% but is still set to lose money on the trade - due to crypto.com's scammy practices and stealing 20% of their funds on the trade.

Interpretation of BTC dominance and Altcoin performance - yesterdays tariff market crash.,"

About 4 years ago the BTC topped of at about 73%. Yesterday during the big stock drama Tariff crash it topped at about 63%. My personal stance it that it can't really go higher. BTC dominance always goes up when markets are crashing - when the fear is at maximum. Yesterday we reached -5% on S&P500 which happens like every few years on very very bad days (even a -2% day on S&P is very rare btw). This leads me to the conclusion that from now on we will see a slow and steady decline it BTC dominance. This would lead to the conclusion that yesterday was the perfect time to buy alt coin. Also note that most Alt coins I watched yesterday were sitting on a very strong support level and didn't break it while BTC also held up very strong compared to the stock market.

The market matured a lot within the last 4 years there are way more coins that will keep money away from BTC because they either created generational bag holding (looking at you $TRUMP haha) or proved that they hold real world value (kiss goes out to HBAR which increased its market cap compared to BTC by more than 300% for example). Therefore the maximum BTC dominance can't to up to more than 63% today I believe.

So yesterday even the last paper hands were shaken out and you could see the limits of market distribution and resistance. 

TL:DR: from my experience I assume BTC dominance topped at 63% and BTC bottomed at 78,6k. Means Alts go up from here. No financial advice.",3,1.0,1743750816.0,Longjumping-Bonus723,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jr5zpi/interpretation_of_btc_dominance_and_altcoin/

Anyone been from 2017-2018 and not make any money?,"I was in crypto from late 2017. Bought bitcoin then it dropped but i bought more and held.. When it started rising many other altcoins also rose. I saw more potential in the altcoins so sold all my bitcoins to trade altcoins. (But possibly I also had some innate gambling problem and didnt have the patience to wait then). I did well into the bull 2021 and made a considerable sum. 

My mistake was believing altcoins had a future.
Since almost all of them returned better than bitcoin in 2021 and many of them had legit use cases and partnerships. The money I made I hodled in alts not in the top 10. I also traded and leveraged alts/memes. My bankroll was a see saw. At times I even made big money but only to eventually lose almost all by end 2024.

I went all in today,"I woke up this morning to see a wall of buy notifications and was surprised to see BTC and alts dip so hard. I suppose it makes sense given the stock market this week but am curious why the two events happened on separate days. 

I have a small personal conspiracy theory that whenever the market dumps on Sunday, the next week will be green, let's see if that theory holds up this week. 

Also I think this may be the bottom for BTC, I know that's kind of a blasphemous thing to say on this sub but if BTC holds above 75k then I'd be pretty confident to say it's going to rebound from here and go to retest 90k. Just my two cents tho.

Also I will say that I bought more eth around 1680 and I'm already regretting that, eth has been nothing but a disappointment as I'm sure most of you know. The only reason I bought more is because I sold some around 1800 and felt like I needed to get back in just in case it pumps but man, what a hot pile of garbage eth has been. 

What do you guys think of eth these days? Still a good buy?

"Bitcoin right now: Different price, Same guarantees.","I've been in the Bitcoin world since 2016.

Over those years, I've seen the price of Bitcoin plummet, and soar, I don't know how many times.

Each time, those who don't understand why Bitcoin exists panic.

They lose faith in the Bitcoin revolution because they haven't bought for the right reasons, or because they haven't studied Bitcoin enough to develop the strength of conviction needed in this unique revolution.

There's nothing extraordinary about seeing the price of Bitcoin fall from $109K to $77K. It's entirely logical and to be expected.

The price of Bitcoin could fall even further. It won't change my view of Bitcoin as long as the fundamentals of the Bitcoin revolution are still there. And they are still there.

With Bitcoin, the price is different right now, but the guarantees of the Bitcoin protocol are the same:

* There will never be more than 21 million BTC in circulation
* 10 minutes delay on average between the issuance of each block of transactions
* An adjustment of the mining difficulty of the Bitcoin network every 2,016 mined blocks
* A decrease in the reward given to miners for every 210,000 blocks issued
* A consensus algorithm based on Proof-of-Work
* Bitcoin is the most secure decentralized network in the world
* A permanently available network (Uptime > 99.989% since Bitcoin creation)
* A never-hacked network
* The data of the Bitcoin Blockchain is immutable
* The Bitcoin code is open-source

Crypto still follows traditional markets… where’s the alternative promised in 2008?,"Bitcoin was born out of a financial crisis. Its whitepaper promised an alternative to the banking system, a currency independent of monetary policies and traditional markets. Yet, with every macroeconomic jolt, BTC reacts, and all the altcoins follow... exactly like a tech stock.

Latest example: Trump announces massive tariffs (20% on the EU, 34% on China), the S&P 500 drops 3%, and BTC immediately follows the trend. Decorrelation? Still looking…

You might think that Bitcoin, as a ""safe-haven"" asset, should have detached itself from traditional markets, especially in the face of a trade war that affects fiat currencies. But the reality is much more complex: 

1. The crypto market is still dominated by institutional players arbitraging between BTC and traditional assets. 
2. **Liquidity**: In times of stress, the big players sell their most liquid assets... BTC at the top of the list. 
3. **The refuge narrative vs the reality of use cases**: Bitcoin might be digital gold on paper, but on the markets, it's still seen as a speculative asset.

**I wonder how to navigate this kind of storm?**

Some solutions are emerging to make BTC more profitable rather than just enduring the volatility. With the rise of liquid staking on Bitcoin (WBTC, BTCB, etc.), the question arises: can DeFi on BTC be a real alternative during extreme volatility or a bear market?

Recent projects like Babylone have tried to make Bitcoin more productive on the blockchain (staking, yield, collateral in DeFi). Others, like the **PumpBTC protocol, even have the backing of a serious exchange like Bitget.** But is this really a long-term viable solution, or just an opportunistic response to volatility?

In short: Is DeFi on BTC a true safe haven, or just another illusion in an already chaotic market? Is decentralization promised by blockchain and crypto still relevant today?

What's the opposite of FOMO,"Like FOMO as in the buying into an asset at any, probably inappropriate, time just to join a bandwagon.

I encounter the opposite. I am observing crypto since 2014, where I once spend like 3k on mining equipment and participated in altcoin shenanigans. Since then I never bought anything in or for crypto again.

I didn't buy BTC at 1k because now it was too high and wanted to wait to ""buy the dip"". I didn't buy when it crashed to 400 a year later because now it's probably never recovering.

I didn't buy BTC at 10k 4 years later because now it was too high and ""lets wait for the dip"" and didn't buy the dip because well maybe it won't survive again.

The same happened at 20k, at 50k at 60k and so on.

Each time I tell myself, ""I should have bought"".

Now I am left with some $4.5k worth of remains of my shenanigans 10 years ago. It's not much but also not nothing. And I still can't get myself into buying in. Well at least I am not at a loss from my one-time investment. But if I had spend that 3k on BTC back then and hold it, I could own half a million now.",42,0.84,1743855971.0,dreamyrhodes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1js2akj/whats_the_opposite_of_fomo/

How I Time the Market in the Dumbest Yet Simplest Way Possible,"I’ve been using an absurdly simple dumb method to time the market. So far, it’s worked shockingly well. No complex indicators, no deep analysis.  

Just pure, unfiltered idiotic, dumbness.  

### Here’s how it works:  

1. **Portfolio Tracking:** I log all my holdings in a portfolio tracker.  

2. **Time-Warped Buys:** Whenever I purchase a crypto, I retroactively mark my buy as if I had entered on the very first day of its existence. Example: If I buy today, but the token launched on Jan 1, 2020, I log it as if I bought it on launch day. Why? To create a historical ""ups and downs"" chart that isn't biased by my real entry.  

3. **The Half-Mountain Rule:** I examine the chart and ask myself one question: Has a **half-mountain** formed relative to past peaks? (Half mountain is the past ATH of my portfolio which now serves as my sell point. **Not** the ATH of the market. And **not** the ATH of one crypto but my whole diversified portfolio over many years. When an ATH hits again, I sell and wait for the other side to form). 

   - **Yes?** I sell everything. Data: [Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/YfiQ0lT.png), [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/BNwwknP.png).  
   - **No?** I keep accumulating. Data: [Currently buying](https://i.imgur.com/hsaaQ6Q.png).  

4 . **Bottom Fishing:** Once a solid bottom forms, I go all in again.  

That’s it. No trendlines, no RSI, no Fibonacci which makes me cringe as hell. Just mountains and valleys.  

This approach has kept me from FOMO-buying tops while letting me accumulate when assets are genuinely undervalued. Obviously, this isn’t financial advice, and I fully expect it to blow up in my face at some point but for now, it’s working. Don’t believe me? Check my post history.  

At this moment, I’m aggressively buying and waiting for the next half-mountain to form, ideally mirroring prior peaks.  

### Important Notes:  
- I track **10+ cryptos simultaneously** this method is useless if applied to just one.  
- This does **not** work for BTC. Bitcoin doesn’t form mountains; it just keeps climbing.  
- Again, **this does not apply to BTC.**",96,0.82,1743127639.0,SquatDeadliftBench,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jlkdfy/how_i_time_the_market_in_the_dumbest_yet_simplest/

"I just discovered that you can combine two Reddit Collectible NFTs to form a Bitcoin logo mashup, which you can then use as avatar or profile pic in Reddit.","Check out my avatar or profile pic in Reddit guys. It's the Bitcoin logo!

I discovered that if you mash the totem and bird seed Reddit Collectible Avatars (RCAs) by the artist showwwy87, you will get a Bitcoin logo mashup, which you can use as your own avatar or profile pic in Reddit. It's so cool!  
  
So how do you get one? First is you need to set up your Reddit vault. To do this, you need to launch the Reddit app in your mobile phone then click your profile pic in the top right corner of your screen. Then choose ""Style Avatar"" button. After that, select the ""You"" tab. Then click ""Your stuff"". And then press the Vault icon to begin Vault setup and follow the instructions to create your very own Reddit vault. For security purposes, you need to write down on a piece of paper your Recovery Phrase and keep it safe in case you need to recover your Reddit vault.

Once you have already your Reddit vault, you can now go shopping for Reddit avatars. To do this, just click your profile pic in Reddit then click ""Style Avatar"" and then click ""Shop"". Then scroll down to the Creators section and click ""All Creators."" You will then see a list of artists, which is in alphabetical order. Scroll down and click the name of showwwy87. You will then see all the avatars that the artist has released. Find and buy his totem and bird seed avatars. 

Once you have bought these avatars, you can click Edit or Style Avatar to do some mashups. To form the Bitcoin logo, you must click the bird seed avatar and click the avatar's right hand trait (the one that appears on the upper left most side). Next, you must click ""x"" or close. Then click the totem avatar and click the avatar's left hand trait and head. Then click ""x"" or close. Then click ""Save"".  And voila, you have formed a mashup and uploaded it as your avatar or profile pic in Reddit!

If you want to hide the eyes, body and legs of the avatar so that only the Bitcoin logo can be seen, you need to buy the Display Box avatar by the artist Bogi\_di. If you have a Display Box already, all you need to do is click on the Display Box's eyes, body and legs in order to make them invisible. And so what remains will just be the Bitcoin logo.

Navigating the Crypto Storm: Why Memecoins Won’t Survive the Recession,"This is not a post intended to convince you to hold onto your investments; in my opinion, memecoin holders especially should finally start cutting their losses or realizing their profits—it’s nonsensical to do otherwise.

While prices may decline much further (watch for market openings in a couple of hours, as well as developments in the coming weeks and months), many investment houses like JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs are now estimating the probability of a recession at over 50% (up from yesterday’s estimate of 35–50%). First, consumers will feel the strain, then companies will begin to struggle, and finally, many people will lose their jobs. The outlook is grim—the direction Trump is taking is toxic not only for crypto but also for the global economy. It’s detrimental to AI and harmful to every industry.

That’s why it’s worth mentioning: if you still want to hold onto your investments, at least reallocate them to projects with real utility and technology that contribute meaningfully to the space—not memecoins! 99,999% will not withstand a recession. No one will hold on to this cult when this space gets hit.

This doesn’t mean these real projects won’t experience price declines, but they are investing significant amounts of money and time right now. If you believe in Crypto, those are the once who will rise from the ashes after this downturn, because they have no other option. They need to advance crypto as long as the current administration remains pro-crypto. This is not speculation; multiple CEOs in this space have stated this in various interviews. These teams are working tirelessly across time zones, 24/7.

Importantly, they don’t currently need your money through investments in their coins—they are already well-funded! You can only benefit from reallocating wisely.

Decentralized coins in particular stand to benefit the most in the long run, because they have the time to innovate and catch up with centralized coins in areas like speed, security, and user interfaces. Decentralized projects such as Cardano, Ethereum, Algorand, Polkadot and many many others are not wasting any time — you shouldn’t either.

What are the arguments against bitcoin's long term success that don't involve the government?,"I can't see any way that bitcoin doesn't go up in the long run aside from some sort of government regulation or crackdown. It's basically gold, except significantly easier to store, send, and receive. Once these ""value retaining"" / ""inflation resistant"" assets with little to no intrinsic value get the ball rolling like bitcoin has, there's basically no going back. There will always be a demand for that kind of asset, especially among the rich who want to keep as much wealth as possible. It's very much available globally, or I guess to anybody with an internet connection. The energy issue is likely to only get better with time. Even during the years when the fed does a great job at combating inflation, not every country will be so lucky. Russian and Chinese oligarchs losing trust in their countries currency and choosing to store some amount of their wealth in bitcoin instead still benefits those of us who hold regardless of what country you're in.

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74)***.***

Welcome! This is the latest report for my homemade 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund. This group contains **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, XLM, USDT, LTC, BSV**, and **Tron.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MARCH Snapshot).**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, no selling or trading, reporting monthly for over 7 years. Did the same in 2019 - 2024. ***Learn more about the history, rules, and FAQs of the Experiments (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **Month 74 update (since Jan. 2019): BTC** in the overall lead by a health margin followed by **ETH** then **Tron**
* 2019 Top Ten Portfolio up +588%, 80% of coins in the green. ***Total Crypto market +2,124% over same time period.***
* **2018+2019+2020+2021+2022+2023+2024+2025 Top Ten Portfolios combined are returning +237% compared to +64% with S&P500 if invested similarly.**

# Month Seventy-Four – UP 588%  

https://preview.redd.it/n00759ayy8pe1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=84b79512b1fc134b05b495e76503c8d4af5b4145

The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, Stellar, USDT, Litecoin, BSV,** and **Tron**.  

February highlights for the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio: 

* Bloody month, as all cryptos end February in the red except **Litecoin**
* **Ethereum** knocked out of first place by **Bitcoin**, which maintains a strong overall lead since January 2019 (+2,170%).  Third place is **Tron.**

# February Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/4pe0d81zy8pe1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c45df9d903505a45b43c0fc60faa4c7857193a

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2019:** After seventy-four months, 50% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten in January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)  have been knocked out.

**BSV** has fallen the furthest in rank so far (#92).

# February Winners and Losers 

***February Winners*** – **Litecoin** (+0.3%) outperformed the rest of the Top Ten by breaking even.  

***February Losers*** – Tough month for the E coins: **ETH** and **EOS** lost -32% and -31% respectively.

# Overall Update: BTC surpasses ETH for the overall lead.  80% of cryptos in positive territory, EOS in the basement.

**Bitcoin** (+2,170% since Jan. 2019), trailing **Ethereum** in the 2019 Portfolio for years, has now overtaken second place **ETH.** 

**The $100 investment into first place BTC on** [**January 1st, 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) **is currently worth $2,314.**

After seventy-four months, 80% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. The worst performer is **EOS** (-78%)**.**

# Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/fwx03hoxz8pe1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=a57b3895f94615c9acef66f159b90d68a73d7836

There was no easy way to do so at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire cryptocurrency market since [January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/), you would be up +2,124%

This is still behind first place **BTC** (+2,170%) but just barely and much better than the rest of the Top Ten cryptos, including second place **Ethereum** (+1,511%).  

The total market is performing much better than the Top Ten approach (+588%) as well.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).

# Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/trhpfuryz8pe1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=0300273dcbe95ee16a96589295cd632da73ea8ef

**BitDom** ended February at 60.1%.

For context, here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination over the life of the 2019 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**38.1% in November 2022.**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46)

High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-eight/).

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:

https://preview.redd.it/2dh8376109pe1.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d27b97a1ef68e7875b5e44640e4fa3c76922143

After seventy-four months, the value of the initial $1000 investment is **$6,875** up +588%. This is down from [November 2021’s all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35) of +665% for the 2019 Portfolio. 

Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up +588%, it is not the best performing of the eight Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment Portfolios: it is still a distant second place behind the [2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56) which is up +809% at the moment.

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, let’s put all eight together now:

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +34% (total value $1,342)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +588% (total value $6,875)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +809% (total value $9,088) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +294% (total value $3,942)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up -21% (total value $793) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +162% (total value $2,619)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +48% (total value $1,483)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): up -18% (total value $816)

So overall? Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/0caly35b09pe1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=41a6f4795b187b6c3804a030f432e151c73bb19f

**That’s up +237%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/b4gn25xc09pe1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb3192318ac4312f1a44ab35e776cd65dfb838a8

In summary: ***That’s a +237% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/1yw205ii09pe1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fd0689ede225b41ecfc11a8c7a490ea3c80d11e

Because the S&P 500 Index is up 138% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto seventy-four months ago would be worth $2,376 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 in January 2019. 

But what if I took the same world’s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&P 500? It would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,228 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,376 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,844 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,585 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,249 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,551 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,012 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,095.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+237%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

Here’s a table providing an overview of the eight year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P:

# Conclusion:

To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate the crypto landscape.  Be careful out there and don’t put your mental, physical, or financial health at risk chasing gainz. If crypto is causing you to lose sleep at night, chances are you have too much in crypto: try to think long term and don’t invest what you truly can’t afford to lose.

Crypto is no different than Stocks,"I've noticed this for a long time and I've always wanted to get everyone's thoughts. Crypto is essentially the same as the index funds. It moves almost 1 for 1 during most financial events. Crypto is just another asset belonging to market makers, banks, and billionaires. Its clear that algorithms control just about everything, and any win the small man gets is pure timing luck. There is no strategy to this lol. 

  
The end of day pump yesterday into the drop today. Its all algorithms right? When did crypto become so tightly coupled with the stock market index(s)?

XRP’s brilliant future.,"Honestly, I don't see a three-figure price increase for each XRP as that far-fetched.

Think about it, with an openmind.

I’m not trying to say something like “the coin I’m holding is better…”, but With all the good news related to XRP this week, such as the dismissal of the SEC lawsuit, or the fact that Ripple can restart its projects without any legal impediment, or the potential benefits that using XRP in current banking for international transactions could unlock, we should be more optimistic.

XRP has a bright future.

I’m going to just wait, Hold and DCA.

Recession talks are heating up.,"Was on WallStreetOasis today, and some people think Trump’s plan to cut **$2T** in government spending to ""support the economy"" could backfire.

If the government had stacked BTC back then, we’d probably already be talking six figures.

Markets are super shaky right now, and meanwhile, Bitget is trying to keep things fun with an **Easter egg hunt**—trade and get a shot at winning a **Tesla Model Y**.

Love it or hate it. Iconic memecoins will outperform anything else this year,"We've probably all realized by now that PvP is toxic and that the trenches aren't fun or profitable. They only benefit a few people.

But I am very optimistic about the future of memecoins that have a real community and whose members are active even in times when the general mood is rather bad.

I think such cult-like memecoins really are a new asset class created by the younger generation. And since they are still relatively low valued, these could really be generational entries that we are looking at right now.

When the general market sentiment becomes a bit more positive again, these cult-like memecoins will fly and many will regret not having bought them now.

And don't get me started on “utility” coins. The vast majority of people who come into the crypto world are primarily looking for money. So they don't care about the supposed utility. With cult-like memecoins they get money and even fun and community.

I am therefore absolutely convinced that cult-like memecoins with a real community and perhaps even a mission or purpose will be the big winners this year.",0,0.41,1743334637.0,UltimaSpes,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jnak0z/love_it_or_hate_it_iconic_memecoins_will/
Why would you need to wire money to play binary options?,"Everyone says she's a scammer as I suspected.  **How would she scam me?**

This woman I met online is trying to teach my how to make money trading crypto binary options.  She’s spent a LOT of time with me, as I’m a newbie.

She can’t be a scammer because everything is in my account, as far as I know.

She keeps saying she wires funds into her Coinbase account because you do better.  She said she has 2.6 million in assets, most likely a lot in her wallet or on Coinbase?

So why would she need to wire more funds?

She said: You are right. We can make a mobile transfer only after we get the details for the bank wire transfer in Coinbase. The information for the transfer needs to follow the wire transfer method provided in Coinbase.           

I still don't understand why she needs to wire with that much assets.?!?!?

 

She also said this:

Yes, my funds are all stored in my internal wallet account, not on the Coinbase exchange, because the exchange does not involve this type of derivative trading. Currently, my assets are approximately around 2.6 million dollars.

What I am about to guide you through is intraday binary options trading in both directions. This method leverages the short-term fluctuations of the market and trades based on the rise and fall of BTC to generate profits. Compared to long-term holding, this trading strategy is more flexible and allows for more opportunities in changing market conditions. Additionally, when we are not trading, the funds are safely stored in your personal account, unaffected by market volatility.

You are right. We can make a mobile transfer only after we get the details for the bank wire transfer in Coinbase. The information for the transfer needs to follow the wire transfer method provided in Coinbase.            

The principle is actually quite simple. For example, if I initially deposit $100,000 (via wire), after two transactions, my principal plus profits will be around $130,000. Similarly, as my savings principal and the number of transactions increase, my funds will gradually grow, eventually reaching the current amount.

"I shoulda listened to warnings not to use Crypto on RobinHood.....Their internal ""review"" process has frozen my crypto","My robinhood account I use for small to few hundred dollar purchases, send/receives, etc with almost exclusively crypto.  I also use CB and other sites but Robinhood seems to have the smallest fees for buying with Debit and for send/receive and they have instant withdrawal in fiat for 1.75%.  Never had a problem until yesterday..

I sent myself one of the largest crypto transactions I've done but its still TINY compared to other people.  I sent myself $413.76 in dogecoin from an external wallet I own.  The transaction now has over 1000 confirmations on blockchain and is clearly a confirmed transaction.  However for some unknown reason Robinhood decided to ""review"" my transaction and now even though the transaction is confirmed on blockchain its been in review for over 20+hours. 

I will gladly edit this post and say its resolved if they can just release my funds but I just don't understand why a few hundred dollar received transaction with over 1000+ confirmations could be under review for so long.  Why am I paying fee's for these transactions if they can just freeze it and say its under review for god knows how long...

Crypto Isn’t What I Expected After Trump’s Win,"I thought everything would go smoothly after Trump won the election and was inaugurated, but crypto has seen more challenges than ever before.  
  
Instead of the stability and massive pump many expected, we’ve been hit with rug pulls, hacks, MEV attacks, and an overall sense of uncertainty. The $1.14B Bybit hack forced OKX to suspend its DEX aggregator, while Uniswap suffered a $215K MEV bot attack, prompting Bitget Wallet to upgrade its MEV protection in response.  
  
With all this happening, myself and a lot of traders have shifted towards DEXs. The rise in trading volume speaks for itself, people are looking for alternatives, causing more DEX activity.

As for memecoins, they pop up now and then, and if you're early, you might squeeze out a win, if not, well, you’re just donating to the devs.

But the real question is: Are we just going to keep moving in circles like this? More uncertainty, more unexpected losses? Is BTC playing games, or are we actually going higher?

Opinion: We Haven't Had a Bull Market Since 2021 [yet],"*Moving my large ass reply from someone else's post into it's own for consideration and comments.* Before I see more people capitulate and post their r/cryptocurrency farewells, lets address the reality of crypto in recent years:

**We never had a proper crypto bull market**. Relative to historical cycles, BTC barely performed.. achieving a 1.5x from last ATH. And this is with Saylor blasting billions into every local top he could. The macroeconomic climate was like a wet blanket on crypto this cycle (more on that later).

BTC had a decent (but small) bull run, but alts never saw a rotation \[alt season\]. They weren't dead; alts logged meager gains since 2022, but the total altcoin market never surpassed 2021 levels, and is currently far below it.

Isolated moves like Solana or XRP were from the remaining crypto holders (us) FOMO rotating our bags into short lived narratives, or gambling on memechain aka Solana. **No new meaningful money entered the space since 2021** (aside from mixed results with ETFs).

\-

**To drive home my point**, lets use stocks: Did you know for the past two years (2023, 2024) that the Magnificent 7 comprised 80% of all gains in the stock market? People were too scared to invest in into anything else.

To me thats pretty clear evidence that we didn't have a real broad-based bull market, we had an isolated rally on the back of AI narratives during an otherwise bearish period, with an unhealthy macro.

BTC performance was similar, ETFs, adoption, Trump- and of course Saylor blasted literal $17 BILLION DOLLARS into BTC and that certainly had an impact.

\-

That doesn't mean progress wasn't made in crypto: on the ETF and regulatory front we had massive wins. In terms of building, some cool stuff happened. 

**But price lagged.. why?**

I'm sure someone will disagree, but imo 90% of the reason is due to the macroeconomic climate.

**The period since 2021's bull ended has been one of declining global liquidity and higher rates: with central banks seeking to squeeze demand from an overheated market.**

**Reducing demand? Less liquidity?** Well it shouldn't surprise you that the first thing to fall, and hardest to fall, is \[very\] risky assets. Guess what is very far out on the risk spectrum? Altcoins! And while BTC is transitioning to a SoV, it still has one leg firmly in high risk still.

Another way to view crypto is as a high beta tech stock. Very volatile but higher RoI than traditional equities if you can stomach the volatility and time it right.

As I said earlier, except for isolated FOMO pumps by mentally unwell people like us that haven't left crypto- we are only seeing minimal new entrants to crypto.

\--

**What are the conditions for a proper bull market** where say BTC exceeds $110k, ETH $5k, SOL $300? We probably want to see like.. 2 or 3 of the items below play out:

\~1.) we need to largely resolve the tariffs; on a 1-10 scale of diplomatically and strategically rolling out new tariffs, with 1 being very strategic and diplomatic, and 10 being anarchist crazy insane: we can score this tariff rollout as a 13.

\~2.) we need the Fed to lower rates more and/or pivot to QE. Note: conditions for this are probably either inflation continuing to tick down (even in the face of tariffs) or something ""breaking"" like a proper market crash and recession in the U.S.

\~3.) we want to see global M2 \[liquidity\] continue to rise, indicating more money for investing, with excess comes additional flows into riskier assets.

\~4.) we want to see supply continue to tick down for majors like BTC and ETH. Given how extreme market conditions are currently, if supply continues to decline, thats a positive sign.

\~5.) separate but related: before any proper alt cycle, we need to see BTC Dominance (market share) retreat to below 50% ideally

  
If you are thinking of capitulating today and selling at lows.. IF you don't need that money, you might be better served holding what you have, and slowly DCA'ing into BTC, ETH, maybe SOL.

Consolidation,"Alright, if you’re keeping tabs on the charts, you’ve clocked it already: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP—the top three—are all in consolidation, trading flat in tight ranges. No breakout, no breakdown, just sideways action. You know the drill, but let’s unpack why it’s happening and what’s next.

This consolidation screams indecision. The market’s basically paused, with traders sitting on their hands. Macro’s a big driver here—interest rate hikes, inflation still lingering, and the Fed’s next move hanging over everything like a cloud. Regulatory noise isn’t helping either; XRP’s still got that SEC/Ripple saga dragging on, and any ruling could flip its script fast. Meanwhile, BTC and ETH aren’t immune—global uncertainty’s keeping everyone cautious.

But it’s not just the outside noise. We’ve got on-chain and ecosystem factors simmering too. Bitcoin’s halving is creeping closer, and you know how that tightens supply and sparks FOMO. Ethereum’s post-Merge upgrades are still settling in, with staking dynamics shifting the game. XRP’s banking on its cross-border niche, but adoption’s a slow burn. The market’s waiting for one of these to light the fuse.

You’ve seen this pattern before—consolidation’s the calm before the storm. Bollinger Bands are probably squeezing, RSI’s neutral, and volume’s drying up. It’s textbook coiling. When it snaps, we’ll get a breakout—could be a bullish run if sentiment flips green, or a bleed-out if support cracks. Check the 50-day MA and key levels; they’ll tell you where it’s leaning.

So, while it’s quiet, don’t zone out. Watch the catalysts—macro data drops, XRP court updates, or a whale move. This range won’t hold forever; the next shift’s coming, and you’ll want to be positioned when it hits.",0,0.38,1742723898.0,Senicko65,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jhvv3k/consolidation/

""""Does This Indicate a Bear Market?
Definition of a Bear Market: A bear market is typically a 20% or greater decline from a recent peak, often with sustained downward momentum (Web ID: 4, Investopedia: “A bear market is a decline of 20% or more”).

BTC’s Decline:
Peak: $109,000 (January 1, 2025)

Current: $83,089 (April 3, 5:53 PM PDT)

Decline: ($109,000 - $83,089) ÷ $109,000 = 23.77%

This qualifies as a bear market, as the decline exceeds 20% from the January 1 peak, a more significant drop than the 14.34% I calculated earlier using the $97,000 peak in early March. Thanks for the updated peak—this changes the context.

Bitcoin is in a medium-term bear market (23.77% decline from $109,000, price below the 50 SMA at $90,000), but the long-term bull trend remains intact (price above the 200 SMA at $75,000). The choppy price action you’ve observed is typical of a corrective phase, and a recovery is possible if BTC holds above $75,000 and eventually breaks above $90,000. Your belief in a recovery aligns with the long-term trend, but the medium-term bear market suggests waiting for confirmation of a trend reversal before entering.""

"Your goal when trading should be to outperform Bitcoin, not just increase your fiat amount","So many people trading crypto miss the primary objective of being in crypto. It’s not to trade to earn more fiat (necessarily), it’s to outperform Bitcoin. Chasing quick wins with other coins often leads to trouble.

Here's the thesis - Bitcoin is always there. You can buy it any time on big exchanges. It has way more trading action than most other coins. You don’t need risky trades on weird platforms or to jump into hyped-up token launches. In TradFi terms, Bitcoin ""is"" the market (VOO/VTI/VT)

Like TradFi, here are some cold, hard facts

* Most traders underperform Bitcoin over any substantial time period
* Wins from influencers can be faked or simply a demonstration of survivor bias
* The next ""big"" micro cap will likely fail to get any attention

You will see KOLs and influencers saying crypto trading equates “alpha” with the discovery of undervalued tokens poised for exponential growth. However, a more nuanced perspective suggests that true alpha lies in the intellectual humility to recognize when a simple, Bitcoin-focused approach is optimal. You won't need to watch charts 24/7, you focus on your craft and make tangible contributions to society while stacking BTC.

If you insist on trading, set goals and monitor your performance not in fiat, but in BTC. If you aren't beating BTC after a certain amount of time, consider pivoting to BTC (or at least a majority of BTC) and rest easier.",0,0.39,1743619748.0,002_timmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jpwgrx/your_goal_when_trading_should_be_to_outperform/

"Bitcoin’s transaction finality now takes over a week due to mining centralization, developer claims","[https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoins-transaction-finality-now-takes-over-a-week-due-to-mining-centralization-developer-claims/](https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoins-transaction-finality-now-takes-over-a-week-due-to-mining-centralization-developer-claims/)

# Bitcoin’s transaction finality now takes over a week due to mining centralization, developer claims

Calls for decentralization grow as Bitcoin's transaction security is challenged by central mining pools.

[Bitcoin](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/) Core developer [Luke Dashjr](https://cryptoslate.com/people/luke-dashjr/) has raised concerns about the finality of Bitcoin transactions, stating that the widely accepted six-block confirmation rule no longer holds.

[According to](https://x.com/LukeDashjr/status/1888445540058251657) him, transaction finalization now takes over a week, casting doubt on Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship.

Finality refers to the point where reversing a transaction becomes practically impossible due to the immense computational power required. Traditionally, this threshold was reached once six blocks were added after the original transaction.

# Why Bitcoin transactions are taking longer to finalize

Dashjr argues that the traditional standard no longer applies due to the increasing centralization of Bitcoin mining pools. In a Feb. 8 X [post](https://x.com/LukeDashjr/status/1888295040113361129), he explained that he attempted to update the six-block confirmation target in Bitcoin Knots, a Bitcoin Core alternative.

However, his calculations indicated that due to Antpool’s significant share of the network hashrate, achieving 95% security now requires over 800 blocks—equivalent to approximately 5.5 days.

[Data](https://hashrateindex.com/hashrate/pools) from the HashRate Index shows that [Antpool](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/antpool/) controls about 16.67% of Bitcoin’s total hash power, trailing [Foundry](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/foundry/) USA at 33.12%. Other major pools include [F2Pool](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/f2pool/) (8.87%), MARA Pool (6.06%), and SecPool (5.19%).

However, Dashjr [disputes](https://x.com/LukeDashjr/status/1888350189897056628) these figures, asserting that several pools, such as Braiins and possibly ViaBTC, act as proxies for Antpool, making its influence far greater. He also noted that many miners unknowingly contribute to potential network reorganizations by operating under centralized pools.

# Industry concerns

Industry experts have echoed these concerns, warning that the increasing dominance of a few mining pools exposes Bitcoin to potential censorship and even a 51% attack.

Bob Burnett, CEO of Barefoot Mining, [said](https://x.com/boomer_btc/status/1888342238616526943) that if a single entity controls a significant portion of the network’s hash power, it could manipulate the blockchain by reorganizing transactions.

He [noted](https://x.com/boomer_btc/status/1888301639322435606):

>*“At a minimum, \[the threat\] is existential to Bitcoin being censorship resistant and it also means immutability takes a very long time to achieve.”*

Considering this, Burnett [proposed](https://x.com/boomer_btc/status/1888305791285022976) that retail investors play a role in restoring decentralization.

He suggested pressuring publicly traded mining firms to spread their hash power across smaller pools, ensuring no single entity controls over 15% of Bitcoin’s network. If miners refuse, he believes investors should divest their stocks and publicly call out non-compliant firms to maintain Bitcoin’s decentralized nature.

Meanwhile, not everyone agrees that this issue is as severe as Dashjr claims. Daniel Roberts, the co-founder of [Iris Energy](https://cryptoslate.com/companies/iris-energy/) Ltd, downplayed these concerns, suggesting that Bitcoin’s design allows it to self-regulate over time.

Roberts [added](https://x.com/danroberts0101/status/1888409190730711463?s=46):

One key reason is the anticipated appointment of Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, as the new SEC Chair. It has boosted confidence in a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrency-based financial products. Many analysts believe that this increases the likelihood of additional altcoin ETFs receiving regulatory approval.   
  
To me, The SEC’s classification of SOL as a security in ongoing lawsuits adds regulatory looks like a challenge to the approval process. With the potential demand for Solana ETFs not being grounded. And Altcoin ETFs getting less money invested in them compared to Bitcoin’s which signifies how investors may not be as interested in them. I know the approval outcome can depend on evolving regulatory perspectives, institutional initiatives, and market demand.

A Future Web3 Without Headaches: The Idea of a Universal Blockchain!,"

Web3 has massive potential, but it's still a minefield for the average user. Between multiple wallets, transaction fees in different tokens, and those dreaded cross-chain transfers, the experience is far from seamless. Honestly, we can only imagine how many millions of dollars are lost every year due to simple mistakes like transferring to the wrong network. 

Here are the problems we all face:

* **Multiple wallets**: MetaMask for Ethereum, Phantom for Solana, Keplr for Cosmos… Each blockchain requires its own wallet. A real headache when you're trying to navigate quickly.
* **Transaction fees in different tokens**: ETH for Ethereum, BNB for BNB Chain, and each chain with its own specific fees. Personally, I’ve often left up to $5 in unused tokens in some wallets because of network fees.
* **Complex cross-chain transactions**: Bridges are often slow, expensive, and swapping… Oof. Nothing simple when you want to move tokens from one blockchain to another.

But then, why not a Universal Blockchain? 

Recently, I came across a project listed on Bitget that’s trying to solve these issues: **Particle Network**. They've managed to secure support from **Binance Labs** and seem to be working on a unified account that would allow interaction with both EVM blockchains (like Ethereum) and non-EVM blockchains (like Solana) seamlessly. The idea is to no longer worry about which blockchain you're using and to pay fees with any token. It's a good start, but for now, it only applies to wallets.

But I have a question: **Will we ever be able to send BTC and ETH to the same address?** 😎 Could we one day unify all this so we don't have to juggle with millions of technical solutions just to make a simple transaction?  
It still seems like a dream, but the advancements in cross-chain tech, like those we see with Cosmos, Polkadot, and others, suggest it could become a reality sooner than expected.

What do you think? Are we still far from a universal blockchain, or are we going to get there in the next few years?

Comprehensive Proposal: XRP as a Strategic Financial Asset for the U.S.A.,"
The review of submission to SEC on March 13, 2025, by Maximilian Staudinger. It outlines a detailed plan to integrate XRP into the U.S. financial system as a strategic asset. Key highlights include:

Economic Benefits:
Unlocking Trillions in Liquidity: Replacing traditional Nostro accounts with XRP could release $1.5 trillion in capital and save $7.5 billion annually in transaction fees.

Bitcoin Reserve Strategy: Freed capital could be used to acquire 25 million BTC, establishing a national Bitcoin reserve.

Regulatory Recommendations
Classify XRP as a payment network rather than a security (SEC).

Remove DOJ restrictions to enable bank adoption of XRP.

Mandate XRP usage for bank liquidity solutions via the Federal Reserve and OCC.

Implementation Plans
Standard Plan (24 months):

Regulatory clearance within 6 months.

Pilot XRP for government payments (IRS refunds, Social Security) within 12 months.

Full-scale banking integration within 24 months.

Accelerated Plan (6-12 months):

Regulatory clearance via executive orders in 1-3 months.

Treasury-backed pilot programs for faster adoption.

Next Steps:
Immediate executive action to classify XRP as a payment asset.

Emergency legislation mandating XRP adoption in banking systems.

Federal Reserve mandates for XRP integration.


This is HUGE!! 💯🚀🚀🚀🌠🇺🇸

Aluminium tariffs and bitcoin,"At first glance, the aluminium tariffs and bitcoin would seem to have no link whatsoever, however, as this [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhUjwQnwtcU)says, aluminium smelters are extremely electricity hungry.

What this means is that if indeed the aluminium tariffs promote (by design or otherwise) the repatriation of smelting capacity back to the United States, i.e., the building of new smelters on the mainland, which hasn't been done in 40 odd years, there will be more competition for the cheap power that the BTC miners currently exploit. I'm thinking, in particular, about some of the renewable 'excess' that the miners like to use.

In considering this potential headwind to profitable mining in the US, and what it may mean for the security of the blockchain, bear in mind it can take 8-10 years to get a smelter up and running.

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the report for the SECOND month of the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 MAR Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7+ years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **FEB Highlights:** Bloody month, all coins in the red. YTD **XRP** is in the lead and the only crypto in positive territory.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+237% vs S&P500's +64% - see below for details).

# Month Two – Down -18%

https://preview.redd.it/krbogpex1uqe1.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=62a09c5bab9e51dd4a091cc97943e49d3f4a6546

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

February highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* All red month with **BNB** and **Tron** falling the least
* **AVAX** drops well out of the Top Ten
* **XRP** in overall lead and only crypto in positive territory

# February Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/1xxa4o822uqe1.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=dffae3797b18e3f425b4a85e30c371feab562daf

Besides the quickly dropping **AVAX**, all coins remain in the Top Ten.

# February Winners and Losers

***February Winners*** – None, although **BNB** and **Tron** fall the least, both -9% in February.

***February Losers*** – **SOL** and **DOGE** (both -37%) underperformed their peers this month.

# Overall Update: XRP maintains lead and is the only crypto in positive territory; after two months, portfolio -18%.

After a fairly good start to 2025 ([the portfolio was +7% in January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1)) the latest Top Ten Portfolio is down -18%.

Year to date **XRP** (+3%) maintains a healthy lead over second place **BTC** (-8%) followed by third place **Tron** (-10%).  The initial $100 invested in first place **XRP** two months ago is worth $103 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last seven years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, two months later: 

https://preview.redd.it/8fgzaim92uqe1.png?width=227&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07259da039dc63ed5a09aad3b55ef6291e69940

**February Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -23% 
* **COIN50**: -24%

The February monthly victory goes to: **The Top Ten Portfolio (barely)**

**Overall since January 1st, 2025:** 

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -18%
* **COIN50**: -22%

Overall lead: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +34% (total value $1,342)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +588% (total value $6,875)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +809% (total value $9,088) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +294% (total value $3,942)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): up -21% (total value $793) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +162% (total value $2,619)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +48% (total value $1,483)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): up -18% (total value $816)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/410gpsxc2uqe1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66c08b1c987c629f4d60c7487672764c06ecb48

**That’s up +237%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/h154ietd2uqe1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=39ce8d8143bee4babf7f74df455d8ddfeeb847cf

In summary: ***That’s a +237% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is up +1% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,012 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,228 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,376 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,844 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,585 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,249 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,551 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,012 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,095.**

That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+237%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  February’s extended report is on the [2019 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74).  For more data, you can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34), [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23), and [2024 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) reports as well.

"Looking for a Bisq/HodlHodl-equivalent in the Ethereum ecosystem (P2P, no-KYC, fiat on/off ramp)","I'm trying to identify whether there's a viable peer-to-peer, non-custodial, no-KYC solution for fiat <> Ethereum (or stablecoins) that doesn't require routing through BTC as a proxy.

Platforms like Bisq and HodlHodl have maintained some resilience in the Bitcoin space, but when it comes to Ethereum, the options seem far more limited. LocalCryptos and AgoraDesk used to partially fill this gap, but they’ve either shut down or are effectively dead, largely due to increasing regulatory pressure.

My ideal criteria would be:

* **P2P** fiat ↔ ETH or fiat ↔ stablecoin (USDC/DAI)
* **Non-custodial** or at least escrow-based
* **No KYC**, no centralized account management
* Preferably open source, or at least with verifiable smart contract logic

I've been digging through GitHub and some smaller DEX protocols but haven't found anything that matches the robustness or decentralization model of Bisq on the Ethereum side.

Does anyone know of any projects (live or in active development) that attempt to solve this in a trust-minimized way? Even if it's still niche or low-liquidity, I'd be curious to test it out.

Bonus points if it's compatible with L2s or privacy layers (zkSync, Base, Aztec, Railgun, etc). Appreciate any pointers.",4,0.75,1743004732.0,cristian0523,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jkf6zz/looking_for_a_bisqhodlhodlequivalent_in_the/
S.T.E.A.L.T.H. OPSEC: A Privacy Framework for Crypto Security,"**Blockchain transactions are traceable.** Maintaining financial privacy in crypto requires both on-chain and off-chain operational security (OPSEC). I've put together the S.T.E.A.L.T.H. framework. It provides a structured approach to ensuring crypto privacy, inspired by cybersecurity best practices and decentralized finance (DeFi).

This model is designed for privacy-conscious crypto users, cybersecurity professionals, and compliance experts seeking to understand both how transaction traceability works and how to mitigate surveillance risks.

# S.T.E.A.L.T.H.: A Privacy-First Crypto OPSEC Model

**S - Split Transactions**

* **Why?** Large, one-time transactions can be easily traced.
* **How?** Use multiple wallets and **split transactions into smaller amounts** over time.
* **Example:** Instead of withdrawing 10 ETH at once, withdraw in random amounts (e.g., 2.3 ETH, 1.7 ETH, 3.1 ETH) at different intervals.

**T - Time Gaps & Randomization**

* **Why?** Forensic tracking relies on patterns and timing correlations.
* **How?** **Randomize withdrawals, deposits, and swaps** instead of making transactions immediately after receiving funds.
* **Example:** Instead of withdrawing from Tornado Cash immediately, **wait weeks or months** before moving funds further.

**E - Erase Traces**

* **Why?** Blockchain transactions are permanent, but privacy tools can disrupt tracking.
* **How?** Use **privacy-enhancing tools** such as **Monero (XMR), CoinJoin, Railgun, or private DeFi swaps** to remove transaction history links.
* **Example:** Swap ETH for XMR on Bisq (a decentralized P2P marketplace), then later convert XMR back to another cryptocurrency before re-entering mainstream finance.

**A - Avoid Centralized Services**

* **Why?** Centralized exchanges (CEXs) log transactions, enforce KYC, and share data with regulators.
* **How?** Use **non-KYC decentralized platforms (Uniswap, Bisq, Haveno) and P2P markets** to transact privately.
* **Example:** Instead of buying Bitcoin via Binance, use **a decentralized Bitcoin swap like Bisq or Hodl Hodl.**

**L - Layered Security**

* **Why?** A single layer of privacy is never enough.
* **How?** Combine **multiple privacy tools** (mixers, decentralized swaps, and cold storage wallets) to create **multiple barriers** against tracking.
* **Example:** ETH → Tornado Cash → XMR (Bisq) → BTC (CoinJoin) → ETH (Uniswap) → Deposit to an exchange in small amounts.

**T - Tor & Tails OS**

* **Why?** Even if your blockchain transactions are private, **your internet connection may expose metadata.**
* **How?** Use **Tails OS, a hardened Linux system, or a premium VPN with Tor routing** to prevent IP address leaks.
* **Example:** Instead of accessing your crypto wallets from a regular laptop, boot into **Tails OS or use a dedicated privacy-focused machine.**

**H - Hardened Execution**

* **Why?** A compromised device can leak financial and personal data.
* **How?** Use **air-gapped wallets, cold storage, and Linux-based OS for transactions** to prevent spyware and tracking.
* **Example:** Instead of using a mobile phone or Windows PC for DeFi swaps, execute transactions on a **clean Linux machine with no tracking software.**

# Who Should Use the S.T.E.A.L.T.H. Model?

The **S.T.E.A.L.T.H. model** is beneficial for: 

✅ **Privacy-conscious crypto users** who want to maintain anonymity in blockchain transactions.

✅ **Cybersecurity professionals** studying **how financial tracking and obfuscation work** in Web3.

Anyone have user feedback on the Ellipal Titan 2.0 or similar cold wallets?,"I have been wanting to move off exchange for some time now but can't seem to pull the trigger on the right cold wallet.  I'm looking for something hyper secure but also easy enough to use, something with a screen that can be used to transfer BTC for payment for everyday use, should I choose. 

I'm comparing the Ellipal Titan 2.0, the Keystone 3 pro and the NGRAVE Zero....but would like to see if anyone on here has any experience using any of these cold wallets, or can recommend better ones.

If there is a better sub to ask these questions please feel free to point me there.

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the Q1 report for the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 APR Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7+ years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **MARCH Highlights:** Mostly red month, only **Tron** and **ADA** green.  **XRP** has overall lead, but all ten cryptos in the 2025 Experiment are underwater YTD.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+218% vs S&P500's +55% - see below for details).

# Month Three – Down -22%

https://preview.redd.it/u5cl3snm38ue1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=a948f0a8c8157146d6ef3ead326e7b44ba05fa56

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

March highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Mostly red month – **ADA** and **Tron** only cryptos to finish March modestly up
* Q1 ends with zero cryptos in positive YTD territory
* **XRP** maintains overall lead

# March Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/qhfj0spq38ue1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff06d20a7f6e5705a3d12b9a2b4c126f05f3d029

Besides the quickly dropping **AVAX**, all coins remain in the Top Ten.

# March Winners and Losers

***March Winners*** – **ADA** and **Tron,** up +1% and +2% respectively.  Second straight monthly victory for **Tron**.

***March Losers*** – **DOGE** (-17%) and **ETH** (-15%) underperformed their peers in March.  Second straight monthly loss for such **DOGE,** much wow.

# Overall Update: XRP maintains lead but slips into negative territory; after Q1 portfolio -22%.

After a fairly good start ([the portfolio was +7% in January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1)) the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio ends Q1 down -22%.

Year to date **XRP** (-3%) maintains a small lead over second place **Tron** (-8%), which is followed by third place **BTC** (-9%).  The initial $100 invested in first place **XRP** three months ago is worth $97 today.

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio stabilized a bit, dropping only $40 month to month – nowhere near as bad as the $250 loss in February. The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$776.**

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last 7+ years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, three months later: 

https://preview.redd.it/doiz8azw38ue1.png?width=465&format=png&auto=webp&s=49fca4e3533c8c59ec20e6141e8f6b1a3845af45

**March Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -5% 
* **COIN50**: -6%

The March monthly victory goes to: **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**

**Overall since January 1st, 2025:** 

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -22%
* **COIN50**: -26%

Overall lead: **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-85): up +25% (total value $1,249)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-74): up +542% (total value $6,420)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-63): up +766% (total value $8,655) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +280% (total value $3,798)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-34): down -25% (total value $753) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-23): up +142% (total value $2,422)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +38% (total value $1,384)
* [2025 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3): down -22% (total value $776)

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$26,959**

https://preview.redd.it/plwr7wx048ue1.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=1295b3ea551ce752e3584c589b6545cea4777948

**That’s up +218%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/hs18tyj348ue1.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=30339161168bfcf19a1f0023e697377e00b08c97

In summary: ***That’s a +218% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

The S&P 500 is down -4% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $958 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,107 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,248 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,744 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,182 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,467 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,181 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $958 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $12,387.**

That is up **+55%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+218%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride.

Best CEXs for decent stablecoins yield,"Hi guys, which trustworthy CEXs are you using to get a decent yield on stablecoins? For example, you can get 10% on Binance for the first 500 USDC so I am planning to use this and combine it with another one. I have some leftover money while DCAing to BTC and don't want to let them in a savings account for 4% yield. I was also checking Nexo, but I am getting Celsius vibes and they have a pretty complicated structure to get a decent yield also you have to lock your funds for months.

Exchange Preferences? (U.S.A.),"I've been using Coinbase but I'm thinking that I'd like to expand and try something else ..... maybe Kraken. I'm open to suggestions.

I mostly just do a monthly DCA, heavy on Bitcoin but I will occasionally pick up some alts with utility (no memes). 

I do use cold storage and most of my BTC stack is there, but my alts and a little bit of BTC is currently on the exchange and I plan to (probably) cash that out later this year. For simplicity, I plan to just keep whots on Coinbase there ... But I'd like to start using another exchange for purchases.

Binance: The New Harbinger of Death for New Tokens? Time to Look Elsewhere.,"Bitget is set to list StakeStone soon, raising questions about whether Binance-backed projects are still safe bets. StakeStone, an omnichain liquidity and staking protocol with over $470M TVL, is designed to optimize liquidity for ETH stakers and BTC holders. However, with Binance Labs as an investor, is it a red flag or an opportunity?  
  
The Binance Effect: Price Manipulation Concerns  
  
For a while now, Binance-backed projects have followed a familiar pattern—hype, a quick pump, and then a steep drop. Whether it’s market forces or something more intentional, traders have started second-guessing anything tied to Binance Labs. Does StakeStone break the cycle, or is history about to repeat itself?  
  
Unlike some past cases, StakeStone isn’t solely tied to Binance. Since 2024, it’s had a wallet partnership with Bitget and also secured $10M from BingX Labs to expand omnichain liquidity solutions. These are also factors I'll consider as I assess the ongoing allegations of market manipulations.  
  
With StakeStone’s Bitget listing coming up tomorrow, I’m using it as my deciding token on Binance-backed projects. Given Binance’s recent allegations of price manipulation and sudden crashes, I’m skeptical. If StakeStone follows that same pattern, it’ll confirm my doubts, but if it holds steady, then our allegations against Binance might be wrong.",6,0.88,1743615732.0,Woodpecker5987,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jpuree/binance_the_new_harbinger_of_death_for_new_tokens/

Aave Integrates Chainlink SVR to Recapture Liquidation MEV and Increase Protocol Revenue,"From chainlinkgod-

Chainlink SVR is officially live on mainnet, featuring @aave (largest DeFi protocol by TVL) as the first user 🔥

Smart Value Recapture (SVR) enables DeFi apps to recapture oracle-related MEV, increasing their protocol revenue while supporting the economic sustainability of oracles

Aave is using SVR to recapture liquidation MEV, starting with an initial collection of markets (tBTC, LBTC, AAVE, & LINK) before expanding in the future

Recaptured OEV revenue will be split between Aave and Chainlink, starting with an initial 6-month discounted rate of 65% to the Aave ecosystem and 35% to the Chainlink ecosystem

SVR is also the first Chainlink service to be connected to Payment Abstraction—a cross-chain payment system that enables service fees to be converted into LINK (more info on this to come!)

Tens of millions of dollars of liquidation MEV have historically been leaked during the block building process, with none returning back to DeFi protocols. SVR fixes this

The Aave SVR upgrade is now in the timelock execution stage, following a near-unanimous Aave DAO vote (~100% approval)",3,0.64,1743271568.0,cryptolipto,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aave-integrates-chainlink-svr-on-ethereum-mainnet-to-recapture-liquidation-mev-and-increase-protocol-revenue-302414191.html
White House Exec. Director Says Gains On Gold Holdings Could Be Used to Buy Bitcoin,"As most know, Trump issued an executive order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, but the treasury could only purchase additional bitcoin for the reserve through tax-neutral actions. The WH Executive Director recently floated the idea of using the gains on gold if the US decided to mark their gold reserve to market...

US Gold Reserves are currently valued at $42/oz, or $11b. If you marked them up to today's prices you would have a value of $791b or a $780b GAIN.

If all of that gain was used to buy $BTC at today's prices they could buy >9m Bitcoin.

What do you guys think of Non Custodial Liquid Staking?,"A friend was a celsius victim in the last bull market and so many others were victims at ftx as well. Both seemed completely legit and offered great staking options till they went bankrupt after defrauding millions of people.   
  
I've been hearing a lot about Non Custodial liquid staking and restaking as a way to earn passive income with crypto while avoiding those collateral damages...  
  
i came across Bedrock's partnership with RockX with a non-custodial approach offering LRTs like uniBTC, uniETH, and uniIOTX, allowing users to stake assets while maintaining liquidity. and there token $BR is already on pre-market sales on top CEXs like Bitget and others ...
